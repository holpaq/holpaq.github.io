<h1 title>Big Bad Book of Klingon Grammar</h1>

<div markdown todo>This intended to be a full explanation of the grammar of the
Klingon language, complete with easily verifiable source references. It is
currently very much a work in progress and many sections below are still devoid
of text.</div>

# Introduction


# The Sounds of Klingon

<div TODO markdown>
* Add notes on mix of upper/lower case (official source for this?)
</div>

The Klingon alphabetical order is as follows:

> {[a](#at)}, {[b](#bay)}, {[ch](#chay)}, {[D](#day)}, {[e](#et)},
> {[gh](#ghay)}, {[H](#hay)}, {[I](#it)}, {[j](#jay)}, {[l](#lay)},
> {[m](#may)}, {[n](#nay)}, {[ng](#ngay)}, {[o](#ot)}, {[p](#pay)},
> {[q](#qay)}, {[Q](#qhay)}, {[r](#ray)}, {[S](#say)}, {[t](#tay)},
> {[tlh](#tlhay)}, {[u](#ut)}, {[v](#vay)}, {[w](#way)}, {[y](#yay)},
> {[’](#qaghwi)}

Note that {ch}, {gh}, {ng}, {tlh} and {’} are considered letters in their own
right, and as a result of this, when words are listed alphabetically the {nob}
comes before {ngab}, {tup} comes before {tlhutlh} etc. The letters {q} and {Q}
also represent two different sounds and are sorted separately.

The names for the sounds in Klingon are {’at}, {’et}, {’ot} etc. for the
vowels, and {bay}, {chay}, {Day} etc. for the consonants – except for {’}
(glottal stop) which is called {qaghwI’} «interrupter».

‹The way Klingon is written with the Latin alphabet was created to make it easy
to teach (American) actors the pronunciation of their individual lines Klingon.
(It was not created with linguists or language learners in
mind.)›<sup>[[Klingon 101, 3:40–3:50]]</sup> Capital letters (e.g. {I}, {H} or
{S}) and unusual letter combinations (like {tlh}) is used to indicate that the
pronunciation of that letter differs from what one would expect in English.


## Consonants

<div TODO markdown>
* Add {w} to phonetic table
* Elaborate on aspiration with English & Swedish examples in which it occur
* Elaborate on the whispering echo of vowels after {’}
</div>

[#bay] {b} [b] (*[voiced bilabial stop]*, called {bay} in Klingon) – This sound
is quite common in Terran languages. It is pronounced as in English *a__b__ack*
[əˈbæk], as in German «:de:__B__ub» [buːp] («boy») or as in Swedish
«:sv:__b__ra» [ˈbrɑː] («good»).

<!--
  <p class="canon">{b} As in English *bronchitis* or
    *gazebo.* <small>[TKD 1.1]</small>a
-->

[#chay] {ch} [t͡ʃ] (*[voiceless postalveolar affricate],* called {chay} in
Klingon) – This sound pronounced as in English *blea__ch__* [bliːt͡ʃ], as in
German «:de:__Tsch__inelle» [t͡ʃiˈnɛlə] («cymbal»), or as in Finland Swedish
«:sv-fi:tjugo» [t͡ʃʉ:gʉ] («twenty»).

<!--
  <p class="canon">{ch} As in English *chew* or *artichoke.* [TKD 1.1]
-->

[#day] {D} [ɖ] (*[voiced retroflex stop]*, called {Day} in Klingon) – In
English, this sound only occur in some dialects, such as in Indian English
*__d__ine* [ɖaɪn] («to eat»). It further back than English *d* in *__d__ream*
or *an__d__roid,* with the tip of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth, at
the back of [the alveolar ridge] (this part of the alveolar ridge is covered
with small ridges). As far as I know, this sound does not occur in German. In
Swedish, the {D} sound exist in most central and northern dialects. This is how
the letters *rd* are pronounced when they occur together, e.g. in the word
«:sv:no__rd__» [nuːɖ] («north»). (This is the result of *r* causing
retroflexation of the following consonant, when it comes before a [dental
consonant].)

<!--
  <p class=canon>{D} This sound is close to English *d* in *dream* or
    *android,* but it is not quite the same. The English *d* sound is made by
    touching the tip of the tongue to that part of the roof of the mouth just
    behind the upper teeth. Klingon {D} can best be approximated by
    English-speakers by touching the tip of the tongue to the roof of the mouth
    at a point about halfway between the teeth and the velum (or soft palate),
    that part of the roof of the mouth that is rather gooshy. As with Klingon
    {b}, some speakers pronounce {D} as if it were more like an *nd,* and a
    distinct minority as if it were {n}–-but, of course, with the tongue in the
    same position as for {D}. [TKD 1.1]
  <p class=canon>The sound at the end of the first syllable of this word,
    {toD}, is {D}. To make this sound, point the tip of your tongue directly
    upwards, and touch the hard part of the roof of your mouth, and the do the
    same thing you would do to make a *d* sound. [CK]
  <p class=canon>For instance {Dal} means «It is boring.» To get the first
    sound in that word right make sure your tongue is pointed straight up
    towards the roof of your mouth. [PK]
-->

[#ghay] {gh} [ɣ] (*[voiced velar fricative]*, called {ghay} in Klingon) – This
sound is not like anything in English, German or Swedish. It is produced with
the tongue in the same position as for *g* – as in English *__g__a__gg__le*
[ˈɡæɡɫ̩], German «:de:Lü__g__e» [ˈlyːɡə] («lie») or Swedish «:sv:__g__ång»
[ɡɔŋː] («path») – but relaxing somewhat and humming. It is a voiced version of
the Klingon {H} sound. In French (and some southern Swedish dialects) there
exists a *guttural r* [ʁ] ([voiced uvular fricative]) which is very similar to
Klingon {gh}, except that it is pronounced a little bit further back. (Using a
*guttural r* instead of the proper {gh} when speaking Klingon, does not lead to
confusion, in fact most Klingon speakers will not even notice that you’re doing
something odd.)

<!--
  <p class=canon>{gh} This is not like anything in English. It can be produced
    by putting the tongue in the same position it would be in to say English
    *g* as in *gobble,* but relaxing the tongue somewhat and humming. It is the
    same as Klingon {H} (see below), but with the vocal cords vibrating at the
    same time. [TKD 1.1]
  <p class=canon>[{gh},] a softer *kh,* with humming (or voicing) at the same
    time [TKDa p. 169]
  <p class=canon>The first sound of the word is {gh}. It’s the same as the last
    sound of {toDSaH}, but hum while you say it. [CK]
-->

[#hay] {H} [x] (*[voiceless velar fricative]*, called {Hay} in Klingon) – This
sound is not common in English but can be heard in some pronunciations of the
American exclamation of disgust *ye__ch__* [jɛx]. It also occur in Scottish
*lo__ch__* [lɔx], and in German «:de:Ku__ch__en» [kuːxən] («cake»). It is a
voiceless version of the Klingon {gh}.

<!--
  <p class=canon>{H} This is also not like anything in English, but it is just
    like *ch* in the name of the German composer «:de:Bach» or in the Yiddish
    toast «:yi:l’chaim,» or the *j* in the Mexican city of «:es-mx:Tijuana» in
    «:en-mx:Baja California.» It is produced in the same way as Klingon {gh},
    but is articulated with a very coarse, strong rasp. Unlike Klingon {gh},
    the vocal cords do not vibrate in saying Klingon {H}. [TKD 1.1]
  <p class=canon>[{H} as in] *ch* in German «:de:Bach» or Scottish «:sco:loch»
    [TKDa p. 169]
  <p class=canon>The last sound in the word is {H}, this is the same as the
    sound at the end of the name of the ancient Terran composer «:de:Bach.»
    You’d make it the same way you make a *k* sound, but force air out of your
    mouth at the same time. [CK]
-->

[#jay] {j} [d͡ʒ] (*[voiced postalveolar affricate]*, called {jay} in Klingon) –
As in English *__j__ump* [ˈd͡ʒʌmp] or German «:de:__Dsch__ungel» [d͡ʒʊŋəl]
(«jungle»), and similar to *dj* in Swedish «:sv:glä__dj__e» («joy») or
*ke__dj__a* («chain»). This sound is always pronounced with a hard initial *d,*
and never softly as in French «:fr:jour» («day») or as Swedish «:sv:jord»
(«earth»). Note: Making a clear distinction between {y} and {j} sounds are
important in Klingon, not least because of the prefixes {yI-}
(«you–him/her/it!», imperative) and {jI-} («I»).

<!--
  <p class="canon">{j} As in English *junk;* never ever as in French *jour.*
    [TKD 1.1]
-->

[#lay] {l} [l] (*[alveolar lateral approximant]*, called {lay} in Klingon) – As
in English *__l__et* [lɛt], German «:de:__L__iebe» [liːbə] («love») or Swedish
«:sv:__l__ång» [lɔŋ] («long»).

<!--
  <p class="canon">{l} As in English *lunge* or *alchemy.* [TKD 1.1]
-->

[#may] {m} [m] (*[bilabial nasal]*, called {may} in Klingon) – As in English
*hi__m__* [hɪm], German «:de:rüh__m__en» [ˈʁyːmən] («to praise») or Swedish
«:sv:__m__ask» [mask] («worm»).

<!--
  <p class="canon">{m} As in English *mud* or *pneumatic.* [TKD 1.1]
-->

[#nay] {n} [n] (*[alveolar nasal]*, called {nay} in Klingon) – As in English
*__n__ice* [naɪs], German «:de:La__n__ze» [ˈlant͡sə] («lance»), or Swedish
«:sv:__n__ord» [nuːɖ] («north»).

<!--
  <p class="canon">{n} As in English *nectarine* or *sunspot.* [TKD 1.1]
-->

[#ngay] {ng} [ŋ] (*[velar nasal]*, called {ngay} in Klingon) – As in English
*si__ng__* [sɪŋ], German «:de:la__ng__» [laŋ] («long»), or Swedish
«:sv:i__ng__enti__ng__» [ɪŋːɛntʰɪŋ] («nothing»). In the most Terran languages
this sound never come at the beginning of a word, but this happen in a number
of Klingon words (e.g. {ngan} «inhabitant»). The letters *ng* are never
pronounced separately (as in *e__ng__ulf*).

<!--
  <p class=canon>{ng} As in English *furlong;* never as in English *engulf.*
    The *g* is never pronounced as a separate sound. This sound never occurs at
    the beginning of an English word, but it does come at the beginning at a
    number of Klingon words. English-speakers may practice making this sound at
    the beginning of a word by saying English *dang it!,* then saying it again
    without the *da.* [TKD 1.1]
  <p class=canon>The sound at the beginning of the second syllable, {ngan}, is
    the same as the sound that comes at the end of the word *thing* or *hang.*
    [CK]
  <p class=canon>That sound in the middle of the last word is the same as the
    sound in the end of the federation standard *thing.* Be sure to say {ngev},
    not {nev} or {njev}. [PK]
-->

[#pay] {p} [pʰ] (*[aspirated voiceless bilabial stop]*, called {pay} in
Klingon) – As in English *__p__ack* [pʰæk], German «:de:__P__ack» [pʰak]
(«pile»), or Swedish «:sv:a__p__a» [ˈɑːpʰa] («monkey»). In Klingon, this sound
is always [aspirated], that is, released with an extra puff off air.

<!--
  <p class="canon">{p} As in English *parallax* or *opprobrium.* It is always
    articulated with a strong puff or pop, never laxly. Speakers of English may
    want to exercise care to avoid discharging saliva while articulating this
    sound. It should be noted, however, that Klingons do not worry about this.
    [TKD 1.1]
-->

[#qay] {q} [qʰ] (*[aspirated voiceless uvular stop]*, called {qay} in Klingon)
– This sound is similar to the *k* sound of English, German and Swedish but the
tongue reaches further back so that it touches the uvula (the fleshy blob that
dangles down from the back of the roof of the mouth). In Klingon, this sound is
always [aspirated], that is, released with an extra puff off air. Never
pronounced *kw* as in English *__q__uagmire.*

<!--
  <p class=canon>{q} Similar to English *k* in *kumquat,* but not quite that.
    The tongue position for English *k* is like that for Klingon {gh} and {H}.
    Indeed, the tongue reaches for or touches the uvula (the fleshy blob that
    dangles down from the back of the roof of the mouth), so articulating {q}
    approximates the sound of choking. The sound is usually accompanied by a
    slight puff of air. English speakers are reminded that Klingon {q} is never
    pronounced *kw* as in the beginning of English *quagmire.* [TKD 1.1]
  <p class=canon>There’s a new sound at both the beginning and end of the
    second syllable {qeq}, be careful, this is not the federation standard *k*
    sound. You make it like a *k,* but as you did for {Q}, shove the back of
    your tongue as far back into your mouth as you can. [CK]
  <p class=canon>{-qoq} – Be sure you pronounce the sound at the beginning and
    end of this suffix as far back in your mouth as you can. [PK]
-->

[#qhay] {Q} [q͡χ] (*[voiceless uvular affricate]*, called {Qay} in Klingon) – It
is pronounced in the same way as {q}, except that it is held longer while air
is forced out. Another way to think of it is that you start off by pronouncing
a {q}, then immediately after releasing it go on to say {H} (without pausing in
between). As in some Swiss dialects of German *Gschän__k__* [ˈkʃæŋq͡χ]
(«present»). This sound is quite uncommon among Terran languages.

<!--
  <p class=canon>{Q} This is like nothing particularly noteworthy in English.
    It is and overdone Klingon {q}. It is identical to {q} except that it is
    very guttural and raspy and strongly articulated, somewhat like a blend of
    Klingon {q} and {H}. [TKD 1.1]
  <p class=canon>To make this sound, put the back of your tongue as far back
    into your mouth as you can, then force the air up harshly, as if you’re
    trying to dislodge a piece of food. [CK]
-->

[#ray] {r} [r] (*[alveolar trill]*, called {ray} in Klingon) – As in Scottish
«:sco:cu__r__d» [kʌrd], German (in some dialects) «:de:Schma__rr__n» [ʃmaːrn]
(«nonsense»), or Swedish «:sv:__r__ov» [ruːv] («prey»). The Klingon {r} differs
from the *r* of American English in that the Klingon one is slightly trilled or
rolled.

Alternatively: {r} [ɹ] (*[alveolar approximant]*) – Many Americans (among them
Marc Okrand, the inventor of the Klingon language) find it hard to roll their
tongue to produce the trill of {r}, and therefore the flat American *r* is an
often heard substitute. It should be noted, however, that pronouncing {r} this
way is a clear indication of a Terran accent.

<!--
  <p class="canon">{r} This is not like the *r* in American English, but it
    does resemble the *r* in some dialects of British English, as well as the
    *r* in many languages of Europe. It is slightly trilled or rolled.
    [TKD 1.1]
-->

[#say] {S} [ʂ] (*[voiceless retroflex fricative]*, called {Say} in Klingon) –
As in the Swedish word «:sv:fo__rs__» [fɔʂ] («rapids»). This sound is halfway
between English *s* (as in *syringe*) and *sh* (as in *shuttlecock*). It is
articulated with the tongue in the same position as for Klingon {D}.

<!--
  <p class=canon>{S} This sound is halfway between English *s* and *sh,* as in
    *syringe* and *shuttlecock.* It is made with the tip of the tongue reaching
    toward that part of the roof of the mouth which it touches to produce the
    Klingon {D}. [TKD 1.1]
  <p class=canon>It’s not quite either the *s* or the *sh* sound you’re
    familiar with. For the Klingon {S}, put your tongue in the same place you
    did to make the {D} sound, and say it with me. [CK]
-->

[#tay] {t} [tʰ] (*[aspirated voiceless alveolar stop]*, called {tay} in
Klingon) – As in English *__t__ick* [tʰɪk], as in German «:de:__T__ochter»
[ˈtʰɔxtɐ] («daughter»), or as in Swedish «:sv:__t__ok» [tʰuːk] («fool»). In
Klingon, this sound is always [aspirated], that is, released with an extra puff
off air.

<!--
  <p class="canon">{t} As in English *tarpaulin* or *critique.* It differs from
    Klingon {D} in two ways: (1) like {p}, it is accompanied by a puff of air;
    and (2) the tongue touches a position on the roof of the mouth father
    forward than that for {D}. [TKD 1.1]
-->

[#tlhay] {tlh} [t͡ɬ] (*[voiceless alveolar lateral affricate]*, called {tlhay}
when spelling) – As in Icelandic «:is:bo__ll__i» [ˈpɔt͡ɬɪ] («cup»), or the name
of the Aztec language «:nah:Náhua__tl__» [ˈnaːwat͡ɬ]. This sound is very
uncommon in Terran languages.

To find {tlh} in your mouth you can start off by saying *l* repeatedly. As you
do this, notice: (1) the tip of the tongue remains firmly rooted to roof of the
mouth with the air passing by on the sides of the tongue, and (2) Your vocal
cords are vibrating (if you put your hand on your Adam’s apple you can feel the
vibrations quite clearly). For Klingon {tlh} (1) is true (the tip of tongue
remains rooted to the roof of the mouth) but (2) is not (the vocal cords are
*not* vibrating).

Continue repeating *l*, but now *whisper* it. (You should no longer feel any
vibrations if you put your hand on your throat.) The sound you’re now
articulating is a voiceless *l*, [ɬ] ([voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]).
You’re halfway to there! – As you continue repeating a voiceless *l*, try
spitting it out with more force. Build up a little bit of pressure behind the
tongue, then lower the sides to spit the air out around it. This is [t͡ɬ] – the
Klingon {tlh} sound!

A different way of thinking about this is that you’re saying *t* in a weird
way. Where you, instead of lowering the *tip* of the tongue, keep the tip in
place, and lower *sides* of the tongue.

<!--
  <p class=canon>{tlh} This sound does not occur in English, but is very much
    like the final sound in «:nah:tetl,» the Aztec word for «egg,» if properly
    pronounced. To produce this sound, the tip of the tongue touches the same
    part of the roof of the mouth it touches for {t}, the sides of the tongue
    are lowered away from the side upper teeth, adn the air is forced through
    the space on both sides between tongue and teeth. The sound is produced
    with a great deal of friction, and the warning given in the description of
    Klingon {p} might be aptly repeated here. [TKD 1.1]
  <p class=canon>To make this {tlh} sound, say a *t* and at the same time
    whisper, loudly, but still just whisper, an *l.* […] Do you feel the sides
    of the tongue going down as you say the sound? – You should. [CK]
-->

[#vay] {v} [v] (*[voiced labiodental fricative]*, called {vay} in Klingon) – As
in English *__v__alve* [væɫv], German «:de:__W__ächter» [ˈvɛçtɐ] («guard») or
Swedish «:sv:__v__ägg» [ˈvɛɡ] («wall»).

<!--
  <p class="canon">{v} As in English *vulgar* or *demonstrative.* [TKD 1.1]
-->

[#way] {w} [w] (*[voiced labio-velar approximant]*, called {way} in Klingon) –
As in English *__w__eep* [wiːp].

<!--
  <p class="canon">{w} Usually as in English *worrywart* or *cow.* On rare
    occasions, especially if the speaker is being rather deliberate, it is
    pronounced strongly, more like {Hw} or even {Huw}. [TKD 1.1]
-->

[#yay] {y} [j] (*[voiced palatal approximant]*, called {yay} in Klingon) – As
in English *__y__ou* [juː], German «:de:__J__och» [jɔx] («yoke»), or Swedish
«:sv:__j__ag» [jɑːɡ] («I»). Note: Making a clear distinction between {y} and
{j} sounds are important in Klingon, not least because of the prefixes {yI-}
(«you–him/her/it!», imperative) and {jI-} («I»).

<!--
  <p class="canon">{y} As in English *yodel* or *joy.* [TKD 1.1]
-->

[#qaghwi] {’} [ʔ] (*[glottal stop]*, called {qaghwI’} or just {’} in Klingon) –
This sound exist in spoken English but is not written – it is the slight catch
in the throat between the two syllables of *uh-oh* or *unh-unh*, meaning “no”.
In some English dialects the letter *t* is pronounced this way, [Cockney]
«:en-uk-Cockney:bo__tt__le» [ˈbɔʔo]. In [BBC English] the letter *t* is
pronounced this way before *n,* e.g. in *bu__tt__on* [bʌʔn̩] (in speech with
careful enunciation, however, *t* is often heard instead).

The Swedish term for this sound is «:sv:[glottal klusil]» (or «:sv:[laryngal
klusil]») and the sound is, just as in English, commonly used, but not written.
It is cessation of sound in the middle of «:sv:öh-oh!» [œʔœ͜uː] («oops!»), or at
end of some pronunciations of the word «:sv:meh!» [meʔ] (used to express
indifference or boredom).

In German this sound is known as «:de:[Knacklaut]» and it precedes any word or
syllable that begins with a vowel. It has been suggested to me that the
difference in pronunciation between «:de:alkoholarmm» («low in alcohol
content») and «:de:alkoholarm» (made-up word, meaning «warning about the
destructive effects of alcohol») would be the addition of a glottal stop in the
middle.

In Klingon, when {’} comes at the end of a word, the preceding sound is
abruptly cut off, and then repeated (after the glottal stop) in a soft whisper.
This echo of the preceding vowel is often extra pronounced when the speaker is
angry or excited. If you articulate the word {paw} («arrive») and {paw’}
(«collide») there should be a clear and distinct sense of abrupt
discontinuation in the latter.

<!--
  <p class=canon>{’} The apostrophe indicates a sound which is frequently
    uttered, but not written, in English. It is a glottal stop, the slight
    catch in the throat between the two syllables of *uh-oh* or *unh-unh,*
    meaning “no.” When Klingon {’} comes at the end of a word, the vowel
    preceeding the {’} is often repeated in a very soft whisper, as if an echo.
    Thus, Klingon {je’} «feed» almost sound like {je’e}, where the articulation
    of the first {e} is abruptly cut off by the {’}, and the second {e} is an
    barely audible whisper. When {’} follows {w} or {y} at the end of a word,
    there is often a whispered, echoed {u} or {I} respectively. Occasionally
    the echo is quite audible, with a guttural sound like {gh} preceeding the
    echoed vowel. For example, {yIlI’} «transmit it!» can sound more like
    {yIlI’ghI}. This extra-heavy echo is heard most often when the speaker is
    particulary excited or angry. [TKD 1.1]
  <p class=canon>Did you hear the sounds cut off abruptly in the middle of the
    word? The correct pronounciation is {Qu’vatlh}, not {Quvatlh}. This abrupt
    cut-off is a very common feature of Klingon, you’ll hear it a lot. [CK]
  <p class=canon>{-na’} Notice how the sound stops abruptly at the end of this
    suffix, it’s {-na’}, not {-naaa}. [PK]
  <p class=canon>Many nonnative speakers of Klingon, especially those for whom
    Federation Standard is a first language, seem to have trouble with {’}, the
    glottal stop, at the end of a word. Articulated correctly, {’} is simply a
    very abrupt cessation of vocalization. The most common mispronunciation of
    {’} is as {q}, though some newer speakers leave {’} off altogether. Errors
    of this type could lead to confusion or confrontation. [KGT pp. 194–195]

## Vowels

<div TODO markdown>
* Add vowel diagram (take from www.klingonska.org/piqad)
</div>

[#at] {a} [ɑ] (*[open back unrounded vowel],* called {’at} in Klingon) –
Pronounced as in [General American] or [BBC English] *sp__a__* [spɑː], or as in
some dialects of German «:de:T__a__g» [tʰɑːk] («day»), or as in Swedish
«:sv:j__а__g» [jɑːɡ] («I, me»). Never as in *cr__a__b__a__pple*.

<!--
  <p class=canon>{a} As in English *psalm;* never as in American English
    *crabapple.* [TKD 1.2]
  <p class=canon>[{a}] as in *pa* [TKDa p. 169]
  <p class=canon>Younger speakers also have a slight tendency to change the
    pronunciation of the vowel {a} in nonstressed syllables to something that
    sounds a bit like the *u* in Federation Standard *but*. If this sound is
    transcribed with the symbol {U}, a word like {qaleghpu’} (“I have seen
    you”) might sound more like {qUleghpu’}. This particular phonological
    inclination seems particularly bothersome to older Klingons and is
    generally considered an error worthy of correction. Students who speak this
    way are customarily reprimanded. [KGT p. 139]
-->

[#et] {e} [ɛ] (*[open-mid front unrounded vowel]*, called {’et} in Klingon) –
Pronounced as in [General American] or [BBC English] *b__e__d* [bɛd], as in
German «:de:B__e__tt» [bɛt] («bed»), or as in Swedish «:sv:__e__n» [ɛn]
(«one»).

<!--
  <p class=canon>{e} As in English *sensor.* [TKD 1.2]
  <p class=canon>[{e}] as in *pet* [TKDa p. 169]
-->

[#it] {I} [ɪ] (*[near-close near-front unrounded vowel],* called {’It} in
Klingon) – As in English *b__i__t* [bɪt], as in German «:de:b__i__tte» [ˈbɪtə]
(«please»), or as in Swedish «:sv:sill» [sɪl] («herring»). This is written with
a capital letter as a reminder that, even though the letter «i» has several
possible pronunciations in English, only one pronunciation is acceptable in
Klingon.<sup>[[Klingon 101, 3:24–4:07]]</sup>

<!--
  <p class=canon>{I} As English *i* in *misfit.* Once in a while, it is
    pronounced like *i* in *zucchini,* but this is very rare and it is not yet
    known exactly what circumstances account for it. [TKD 1.2]
  <p class=canon>[{i}] as in *pit* [TKDa p. 169]
-->

[#ot] {o} [o] (*[close-mid back rounded vowel]*, called {’ot} in Klingon) –
Pronounced as English *g__o__* [goː], in German «:de:__o__der» [ˈoːdɐ] («or»),
or as in Swedish «:sv:__å__ka» [ˈoːka] («travel»). (There are no words that end
in {ow}, as that would be indistinguishable from just {o}.)

<!--
  <p class=canon>{o} As in English *mosaic.* [TKD 1.2]
  <p class=canon>[{o}] as in *go* [TKDa p. 169]
  <p class=canon>No words in Klingon have {ow} or {uw.} If they did, they would
    be indistinguishable from words ending in {o} and {u,}
    respectively. [TKD 1.2]
-->

[#ut] {u} [u] (*[close back rounded vowel],* called {’ut} in Klingon) –
Pronounced as in [General American] or [BBC English] *b__oo__t* [buːt], or as
in German «:de:F__u__ß» [fuːs] («foot»). Never pronounced as in *b__u__t* or
*c__u__te*. (There are no words that end in {uw}, as that would be
indistinguishable from just {u}.)

<!--
  <p class=canon>{u} As in English *gnu* or *prune;* never as in *but* or
    *cute.* [TKD 1.2]
  <p class=canon>[{u}] as in *soon* [TKDa p. 169]
  <p class=canon>No words in Klingon have {ow} or {uw.} If they did, they would
    be indistinguishable from words ending in {o} and {u,} respectively.

## Stress

<div TODO markdown>
* Source for adjectival and nominalized stress? (Hamlet appendix)
* Examples of stress (including at least one where it’s used for disambiguation)
</div>

**Verbs** are stressed on the last syllable of the stem, and the first suffix
is unstressed. After that, any additional suffixes ending in {’} are also
stressed. Exception: The speaker may emphasize a suffix by shifting the stress
to it, and leave the rest of the word unstressed (this frequently happens with
{-’a’}, {-be’}, {-Qo’}, {-Ha’}, and {-qu’}). **Adjectival verbs** are stressed
as verbs.

**Nouns** are usually stressed on the last syllable of the stem, however if
there are any syllables in the word that end in {’}, then those syllables are
stressed instead (if there are more than one, they are equally stressed).
**Nominalized verbs** (nouns made with {-wI’} or {-ghach}) are stressed as
nouns.


# Klingon Writing

<div TODO markdown>
* Add canon {pIqaD} fonts (from Haynes manual, Discovery – more?)
</div>

The Klingon writing system, {pIqaD}, is an alphabet which closely corresponds
to the romanized spelling of Klingon. Each sound have one symbol, and there are
two punctuation marks.
