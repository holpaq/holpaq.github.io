[#intro] This page is an attempt to collect in one place all the addenda,
corrections, clarifications and accepted conventions for {tlhIngan Hol} that
have appeared since the publication of *The Klingon Dictionary* in 1992. The
entries are keyed to the section numbers of TKD, and each entry includes the
original source of the addendum (if possible). In order to avoid copyright
infringement, and to encourage you to seek out the sources, the entries are
paraphrased, rather than quoted directly. Don’t consider this page to be a
substitute for the originals; every serious student should own the original
texts, if only to see how accurately I’ve interpreted them.

Within each section, the entries are classified under one of three degrees of
reliability: Those in **bold type** represent direct statements from Marc
Okrand (the language’s creator and only source of canon), those in `plain type`
represent grammar inferred from canon examples but not directly addressed by
Marc Okrand (I defer to the members of the Klingon Language Institute and its
associated mailing list for the interpretation of these canon examples), and
those in *italic type* represent the accepted usages of the KLI and its
members, while recognizing that these usages have no canonical standing (there
is some overlap between these last two categories, since hopefully we base our
usage on canon). Finally, you can read my own commentaries on a given topic by
clicking on the [Commentary](#commentaries) link.

You the reader should consider **bold** entries to be as authoritative as TKD
itself, `plain` entries to be reliable but not set in stone, and *italic*
entries primarily as unofficial guides to good usage. My own commentaries, of
course, are my opinions only and should be given no more weight than they
deserve.

A final note: This page is concerned only with grammar. It does not consider
any lexical topics, such as the transitivity of a given verb or new or expanded
meanings for existing words, unless specifically related to a more general
point of grammar.

I want this page to be as accurate and inclusive as possible, so if I’ve
omitted something or stated it wrongly, please
[e-mail](mailto:teresh@tdonnelly.org) me with the correction.

# [#sounds] 1. The Sounds of Klingon

## 1.1 Consonants

  1. *{Q} is pronounced [q_X] (in X-SAMPA phonetic transcription), or basically
     like an aspirated {q}, that is, {q} followed closely by a raspy puff of
     air* [KLI: M. Shoulson, 2/20/98, Re: Introduction]

  2. **Doubled letters are pronounced either as a lengthening of the letter, or
     with a brief break between the two letters. Some speakers incorrectly
     pronounce the double letter as a single letter; this is especially true
     for {’’} (two glottal stops).** [KGT, p.138]

# [#nouns] 3. Nouns

## 3.1 Complex nouns

> ### [#nouns-321] 3.2.1 Compound Nouns
>
>   1. **Don’t assume that any naked verb can be used as a noun, just because

>   2. *Don’t try to break compound nouns into parts and use the parts either
>      alone or in other compounds.* [KLI: A. Anderson, 4/13/97, Re: SopDaq]
>
>   3. *Don’t coin new compound words from existing parts.* [KLI: D. Trimboli,
>      11/30/96, Re: KLBC: Re: This message is too long]
>
>      [Commentary](#commentary-321)
>
> ### 3.2.2 Verb plus {-wI’}
>
>   1. In reference to inanimate objects, this suffix means “thing which does”
>     ({joqwI’}) or “thing which is used for” ({nanwI’}). [TKD, KGT]
>
>   2. [#nouns-322] In reference to animate beings, this suffix means “one who

>
>     [Commentary](#commentary-322)


## 3.3 Suffixes

> ### 3.3.1 Augmentative/diminutive
>
> > [#nouns-331] *These suffixes are not simply equivalent to {tIn/mach}, but

> > has lost the power of speech).** [KLI: S. Boozer, 7/12/98, Anecdotal
> > Okrand]
>
>
> ### 3.3.5 Syntactic markers
>
>   1. **{-Daq} and {-vo’} are strictly locative; they refer only to
>      __motion__, or __location__. They can’t be used in other situations in
>      which English uses “to”, “in” or “from” in a metaphorical sense (eg. “I
>      translate from English to Klingon”; you can’t use {-Daq} for “to” or
>      {-vo’} for “from”).** [HQ v8n1p7]
>
>   2. **Some prepositional concepts in English are verbs in Klingon: eg.
>      {tlhej} for “with”, both in the sense of “accompanying” and “doing
>      something together with”, eg. {Dargh vItlhutlh ’ej mutlhej torgh} “Torg
>      drinks tea with me.”** [HQ v2n4p18].
>
>   3. [#nouns-3353] *It seems that a noun with a Type 5 suffix can modify a
>      single noun (as opposed to whole sentences), eg. {ghe’’orDaq luSpet} “a
>      black hole in the Netherworld”.* [PK, BOP]
>
>      [Commentary](#commentary-3353)
>
>   4. [#nouns-335] **Verbs of motion have different meanings when used with
>      and without {-Daq} and object prefixes:**
>
>      * **{X(-Daq) vI-Y} “I Y to X” ({-Daq} is optional);**
>      * **{X-vo’ vI-Y} “I Y away from X”;**
>      * **{X-Daq jI-Y} “I Y at/on/in X”.**  
>        [HQ v7n4p8]
>
>      [Commentary](#commentary-335)
>
>   5. The use of suffix {-’e’}: [Commentary](#suffix-e)


## 3.4 The noun-noun construction

  1. [#nouns-34] This construction doesn’t just show possession, but is also
     used as the grammatical Genitive. That is, it forms phrases that are
     equivalent to English adjectives of origin {romuluS HIq}, composition {peQ
     chem}, or location {tlhIngan wo’}. [HQ v3n3p6]

     [Commentary](#commentary-34)

  2. Multiple N-N-N(-N...) formations are allowed. eg. {SuvwI’ qa’ patlh} “a
     warrior’s level of spiritual attainment” [S33]

  3. [#nouns-34b] Noun apposition, different from the N-N construction, is
     allowed, eg. {DuraS be’nI’pu’ be’etor lurSa’ je} “Duras’s sisters, Betor
     and Lursa” [S26; HQ v3n1p5]

     [Commentary](#commentary-34b)

  4. Nouns representing locative prepositional concepts, such as {retlh, bIng,
     botlh}, etc., when used with pronouns, follow the pronoun in a N-N
     formation, and the pronoun suffixes are not used, eg. {jIH retlhDaq}
     “alongside me”, not {\*retlhwIjDaq} [KGT, p. 24]

# [#verbs] 4. Verbs

## 4.1 Pronominal prefixes

> ### 4.1.1. Basic prefixes
>
> > [#verbs-411] **The prefix trick: When a verb has a first or second person
> > indirect object (marked with {-vaD}), and a third-person object or no
> > object, the indirect object can be shown by using a verb prefix whose
> > object is the appropriate person: eg. {SoHvaD paq vInob} = {paq qanob} “I
> > give you a book”; {HInob} “Give it to me!”** [MSN, 6/97]
> >
> > [Commentary](#commentary-411)


## 4.2. Verb suffixes

> ### 4.2.1 Oneself/One another
>
> > **Imperatives with stative verbs require the extra suffixes {-’eghmoH}, eg.
> > {yItuj’eghmoH} “Warm yourself!”** [KGT p.117]
>
>
> ### 4.2.4. Cause [Commentary](#suffix-moh)

<!--
> > [#verbs-424] When adding {-moH} to transitives, you can use {-vaD} to
> > indicate the noun compelled to act, eg. {ghaHvaD quHDaj qawmoH (Ha’quj)}
> > “His sash reminds him of his heritage” (literally “The sash
> > causes-to-remember his-heritage to-him” [S20]
>
> [Commentary](#commentary-424)
-->

> ### 4.2.5. Indefinite subject/ability
>
> > **The verb prefix {lu-} when used with the indefinite suffix {-lu’} and
> > with plural objects is often omitted, especially in equivalents to English
> > “There is/are” sentences, although this is somewhat ungrammatical, eg.
> > {naDev tlhInganpu’ tu’lu’} “There are Klingons here”** [KGT p. 171; HQ
> > v7n3p4]
>
>
> ### 4.2.7. Aspect
>
> > [#verbs-427] **The perfective suffixes {-pu’/-ta’} do not indicate past
> > tense. Klingon has no tenses. They indicate action completed in the time
> > context of the rest of the discourse. The time context may be present, past
> > or future.** [CK; HQ v2n1p10; HQ v2n4p11]
> >
> > [Commentary](#commentary-427)
>
>
> ### 4.2.9. Syntactic markers
>
>   1. **The placement of verbs with {-jaj} in the sentence depends on the type
>      of sentence: with formal toasts, the order of the sentence is O-S-V, eg.
>      {’IwlIj jachjaj} “May your blood scream” , but in regular sentences, it
>      is the usual O-V-S, eg. {jejjaj tajlIj} “May your knife be sharp.”**
>      [KGT. p.25]
>
>   2. Verbs with {-jaj} may take Type 7 aspect suffixes (*contra* TKD), eg.
>      {wo’ DevtaHjaj ghawran} [KGT, p. 25]
>
>   3. [#verbs-429] **Verbs with {-ghach} are very rare and highly marked.
>      These nominalized verbs are not generally the equivalent of simple
>      nouns, but of abstracts and process nouns (those in English with
>      suffixes like *-ness, -tion*), so most examples require another verb
>      suffix in addition to {-ghach}, such as {-taH}. These nominalized verbs
>      never take subject/object prefixes.** [HQ v3n3p10]
>
>      [Commentary](#commentary-429)


## 4.4. Adjectives

  1. [#verbs-44] **When a noun has more than one adjective, one of the
     following forms is used: {SuD Dargh ’ej wov} or {SuDbogh Dargh ’ej
     wovbogh}** [KGT p.82]

    [Commentary](#commentary-44)

  2. [#verbs-44b] *Descriptive verbs used adjectivally (i.e. after the noun) we
     have seen take only the suffixes {-qu’} ({tInqu’}), {-Ha’} ({ngaDHa’}) and
     {-be’} ({lo’laHbe’}).* [TKD, KGT, p 150]

# [#other] 5. Other kinds of words

## 5.2 Numbers

  1. [#other-52] Most quantity words appear to behave like numbers and come
     before the noun: {Hoch X} (**Note: {Hoch X} plus singular noun = “each X”;
     plus plural noun = “all the Xs”**) [HQ v5n2p11], {’op X} “some Xs” [S7],
     {latlh X} “(an)other X/Xs” [S31], {bID X} “half an X, a half X” [BOP]

     [Commentary](#commentary-52)

  2. When {Hoch} follows the noun, it appears to refer to the entirety of the
     noun, eg {nIn Hoch natlhlu’pu’} “All the fuel is used up” [KGT p. 155]

  3. [#other-52b] The quantity word {HochHom} appears to come after the noun
     [S15]

     [Commentary](#commentary-52b)

  4. Number phrases with {vatlhvI’} are considered numbers and come before the
     noun, eg. {cha’maH vagh vatlhvI’ Hong} “One quarter impulse power”. [ ST5;
     KLI: S. Boozer, 5/21/99, Re: vatlhvI’]

  5. *Type 5 noun suffixes come after a noun + ordinal number or noun + number
     label phrase: {Duj wejDIchDaq} “In the third ship”; {Duj wejDaq} “in Ship
     No. 3”* [HQ v5n1p17]


## 5.4 Adverbials

  1. One can use {-Ha’} to form the opposite of some adverbs, eg. {Do’Ha’} [HQ
     v4n4p11; KGT, p. 148]

  2. **Time stamps simply come at the head of the sentence, and require no
     special marking. They can be combined to convey more precise times, eg.
     {DISvam} “this year”, {wej Hu’} “3 days ago”, {DaHjaj po} “this morning”**
     [MSN, 6/30/97]

  3. *Duration stamps must be rendered by verb phrases, eg. {qaStaHvIS wej rep}
     “for three hours”, {nI’taHvIS poH} “for a long time”* [KLI: D. Trimboli,
     11/5/98, Re: KLBC yu’wI’; KLI: M. Shoulson, 7/28/97, Re: KLBC + And now,
     the news]

  4. [#other-54] Ordinals may be used as a kind of time stamp indicating number
     of distinct events, eg. {wa’DIch tlhIngan Dujmey luleghlu’pu’bogh...}
     “Klingon ships seen for the first time...” [S15]

     [Commentary](#commentary-54)


## 5.6 Names and address

  1. [#other-56] Names can be stated in a couple of ways: {X-vaD Y ponglu’} “X
     is called Y” [S27]; and {X ’oH pongwIj’e’} “X is my name” [FAQ]

     [Commentary](#commentary-56)

  2. **The full form of address for a Klingon is {worIv, mogh puqloD, martaq
     tuq} “Worf, son of Mog, of the House of Martok”. Except in the most formal
     circumstances, it is proper to address a Klingon by the first name only.**
     [KGT p.197; MSN, 9/8/97]

  3. **Titles follow names, eg. {tlha’a HoD} “Captain Klaa”** [KGT p.5]

  4. Geographical regions seem to follow this same formula, eg. {Sa’Qej Sep}
     “Sakrej Region” [KGT, p.16]

# [#syntax] 6. Syntax

## 6.1. Basic Sentences

  1. **Some complex sentences in English will be rendered as two or more
     simpler sentences in Klingon** [HQ v3n1p3; HQ v4n2p5]

  2. Impersonal sentences (“It” sentences, where “it” doesn’t refer to anything
     specific) seem to be allowed, eg. {SIS} “It’s raining” [KLI: S. Boozer,
     7/12/98, Anecdotal Okrand]


## 6.2. Complex sentences

> ### 6.2.1. Compound sentences
>
>   1. **The conjunction {’ej} merely indicates the (simultaneous?) occurence
>      of two events; there is no time sequence implied, eg. {mabom ’ej
>      matlhutlh} “We sing and we drink”, not \*“We sing and then drink”**
>      [MSN, 3/20/98]
>
>   2. Sequence seems to be indicated by the lack of a conjunction, eg. {bogh
>      tlhInganpu’, SuvwI’pu’ moj, Hegh} “Klingons are born, become warriors,
>      then die.”; {beyHom bey bey’a’ jachtaH} “They are letting out an
>      ever-louder howl.” [TKW, p5; S31]
>
>   3. The “sentence” conjunctions can be used with verbal phrases as well as
>      complete sentences, eg. {SuvmeH ’ej charghmeH bogh tlhInganpu’} [TKW, p
>      5, et al.]
>
>
> ### 6.2.3. Relative clauses
>
>   1. **You can mark the head noun of a relative phrase (subject or object of
>      the {-bogh} verb) with {-’e’}: {HoD’e’ qIpta’bogh yaS vIlegh} “I see the
>      captain who was hit by the officer” (not “I see the officer who hit the
>      captain”).** [HQ v1n3p4]
>
>   2. [#syntax-623] You may be able to use any Type 5 suffix to mark the head
>      noun of a relative phrase: {meQtaHbogh qachDaq Suv qoH neH} “Only a fool
>      fights in a burning house”. [TKW, p.111; S99]
>
>      [Commentary](#commentary-623)
>
>   3. *Headless relatives (i.e., relative {-bogh} words with no expressed
>      subject or object, eg. {\*SuHeghbogh} “You who are dying”) are probably
>      not allowed.* [FAQ; HQ v1n3p5]
>
>
> ### 6.2.4. Purpose clauses
>
>   1. [#syntax-6241] Verbs with {-meH} can modify nouns as well as verbs, eg.
>      {pe’meH taj} “cutting knife”. They are able to take actual subjects
>      and/or objects. [HQ v7n3p6; HQ v7n2p14; KGT, p.63]
>
>      [Commentary](#commentary-6241)
>
>   2. [#syntax-6242] *Such verbs can be used to express Sentences as Subjects,
>      eg. {nargh qaSuchmeH ’eb} “the opportunity to visit you has passed”.*
>      [HQ v7n2p14]
>
>      [Commentary](#commentary-6242)
>
>   3. [#syntax-624] Verbs with {-meH} must take verb prefixes, if only the
>      3-rd person zero-prefix, when appropriate. [HQ v8n2p12]<br markdown>
>
>      [Commentary](#commentary-624)
>
>
> ### 6.2.5. Sentences as Objects
>
>   1. *Adverbs with {’e’} come after the object sentence and before the {’e’},
>      eg. {paw Duj wej ’e’ vIlegh} “I haven’t seen the ship arrive yet”.* [HQ
>      v1n2p11]
>
>   2. The object pronoun {’e’} can refer to an entire previous sentence: {’e’
>      neHbe’ vavwI’} “That (i.e., some previous sentence) isn’t what my father
>      wanted” [ST6].
>
>   3. **The verb {jatlh} can take an object, but only a noun describing a

## 6.4. Questions

  1. [#syntax-64] **We have no indirect question/relative adverbs and thus no
     way to directly express Questions as Objects, and must recast them**. [HQ
     v6n4p12; KLI: S. Boozer, 7/12/98, Anecdotal Okrand]

     [Commentary](#commentary-64)

  2. **We have no word for the question word “which” and must recast the
     sentence, eg. {nuH DaneHbogh yIngu’} “Which weapon do you want?”
     (literally “Identify the weapon which you want!”).** [KGT, p105; KLI: K.
     Traft, 12/15/96, Dr. Okrand Speaks -- lengthy]


## 6.6. Comparatives and superlatives

What can fill the slots of the {A Q law’/B Q puS} construction:

  1. {A} and {B} can be any noun or noun phrase, eg. {targhwIj yab tIn law’
     no’lI’ Hoch yabDu’ tIn puS}. [PK]

  2. Noun and verb phrases can precede the entire construction, eg. {reH latlh
    qabDaq qul tuj law’, Hoch tuj puS}; {tlhutlhmeH HIq ngeb qaq law’ bIQ qaq
    puS} [PK; HQ v2n2p3; TKW p75 ]

  3. **{A} and {B} can be pronouns** [HQ v4n2p3]

  4. **Other contrastive pairs can replace {law’/puS}, eg. {HoS/puj}.** [KGT
     p.178]

  5. Only descriptive verbs can fill the {Q} slot, and then only in a predicate
     fashion, so you must use some other formula for other types of
     comparisions, such as sentences with {nIv} or {-qu’}, eg. **{bortaS nIvqu’
     ’oH bortaS’e’} “Revenge is the best revenge”**; *{jach yaS ’ach jachqu’
     HoD} “The captain shouts louder than the officer.”* [HQ v4n3p15; TKW, p
     121, et al].

# [#expressions] Appendix: A Selected List of Useful Klingon Expressions

  1. [#expressions-ab] **Telling time: Hours are expressed in 24-hour time.
     Generally, you can “ask” the time with the phrase {rep yIper} “Label the
     hour!” . You answer with a time label: {rep wej} “three A.M.”; {rep
     cha’maH} “20 hours (i.e. 8 P.M.)”; {rep loS wejmaH} “4:30 A.M.” You can
     also use the phrase {’arlogh Qoylu’pu’} “How many times has it (*a signal
     bell, maybe*) been heard?”. This can be augmented with other elements,
     eg., {mamejDI’ ’arlogh Qoylu’pu’} “What time do we leave?” You answer with
     the number of times: {cha’logh} “two o’clock”.** [SK, 2/3/99]

     [Commentary](#commentary-ab)

  2. **Similes are expressed by a phrase with an adjective and a following
     metaphorical phrase, eg. {puj SuvwI’vetlh; bIQ rur} “That warrior is as
     weak as water”.** [KGT, p.127]

  3. **Color terms can be made more specific by additional adjectives or by the
     simile method shown above, eg. {SuD ’ej wov} “yellow”; {Doq ’ej Qaj wuS
     rur} “Kraj-lip red” or “brown”; {Doqqu’} “deep red”.** [KGT p.82; HQ
     v8n1p7]

  4. **Age is expressed by the formula {# ben jIboghpu’} “I am # years old”
     (literally “I was born # years ago”); as a question, it is {ben ’ar
     bIboghpu’}** [SK, 12/15/96]

  5. [#expressions-aa] **The verbs {Sum/Hop} generally refer to location in
     relation to the speaker, ex., {Sum raS} “The table is near to me”. To
     change the referent of the verb, you can use {-Daq}, eg., {yaSDaq Sum raS}
     “The table is near the officer”.** [HQ v7n4p10]

# [#commentaries] Commentaries

<small>You might wonder what qualifies me to put this list together. Well, I’ll
let you decide if I’m qualified; I’ll just give you my credentials. I’ve been
studying Klingon since the revised TKD came out in 1992, I’ve been a member of
the KLI and its mailing list since 1993, I’m the author of the Klingon
automated vocabulary program KLIFLASH, and I’ve had 2 articles published in
*HolQeD* (the KLI’s scholarly journal) and three stories in *jatmey* (the KLI’s
literary journal). One of these has been optioned for a screenplay by the
Klingon Language Division of Paramount Pictures. (*OK, I made that last part
up; a guy can dream, can’t he?*)</small>


### 3.2.1. Compound nouns

> [#commentary-321] These last two are not so much stated rules as impressions
> we’ve gotten from MO over the years. You will sometimes encounter *ad-hoc*
> compounds. But beware of the “hind-sight” effect: the compound word that
> seems so clear to you may make no sense at all to someone else.
>
> [Back](#nouns-321)


### 3.2.2 Verb plus {-wI’}

> [#commentary-322] This suffix is actually defined in TKD, but in a confusing
> and incomplete way.
>
> [Back](#nouns-322)


### 3.3.1 Augmentative/diminutive

> [#commentary-331] These suffixes are defined in TKD, but this point is not
> clearly made there.
>
> [Back](#nouns-331)


### 3.3.2 Number

> [#commentary-332] There is evidently some latitude in the grey areas. MO
> tells us on the MSN forum that {DIr} has the plurals {DIrDu’} and {DIrmey}
> depending on whether it is still on the animal, or off of it. (Does this mean
> that, if I serve my guests Pipius Claw and each one gets several, I would
> refer to them as {pachmey}?). However, in KGT, he describes the handles of a
> type of pot as {DeSDu’}, although they were obviously never alive at all!
>
> My theory is that Klingons are deeply interested in whether a body part is
> still attached to its body and alive {-Du’}, or detatched and dead {-mey}.
> Their interest in the bodies themselves is different, where their only
> concern is whether it is a person {-pu’} or a non-person {-mey}. In the case
> of inanimate objects, their interest in body parts causes the Klingons to
> confer “honorary” status as a body part on objects that resemble them; these
> objects receive the {-Du’} suffix to make the identification clear.
>
> This could also be the origin of the “scattered around” meaning of {-mey}.
> When a body part is separated from its body, its plural changes from {-Du’}
> to {-mey}, and separation could come to imply not merely removal but
> dispersal; eventually this “dispersal” meaning could be generalized to words
> whose usual plural is {-pu’}.
>
> [Back](#nouns-332)


### 3.3.5 Syntactic markers

> [#commentary-3353] As has been pointed out [HQ v6n2p2], this construction is
> most likely not an example of the N-N pattern, but a contraction of something
> involving a {-bogh} verb: {balDaq chenmoHlu’bogh Duj} *ship (which someone
> assembled) in a bottle*. But, since they functionally act the same way, the
> point is probably moot.
>
> We usually call this the “Cat-In-The-Hat” problem; ironically, it doesn’t
> really apply to this situation. “In the hat” doesn’t mean the Cat is sitting
> inside a hat, rather, it’s an English idiom for “wearing a hat” and would
> probably be translated {mIv tuQtaHbogh vIghro’}.
>
> [Back](#nouns-3353)
>
> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
>
> [#commentary-335] This is a restricted and special usage, and should not be
> overused or generalized to other types of verbs or noun phrases. I’ve been
> trying to explain the new rules to myself:
>
> <dl markdown>
>   <dt markdown>{X(-Daq) vI-Y}
>   <dd markdown>The ground-work for this phrase was actually laid in TKD,
>     where MO says that **“There are a few verbs whose meanings include
>     locative notions, such as {ghoS} «approach, proceed». The locative suffix
>     need not be used on nouns which are the objects of such verbs.”** [TKD,
>     p. 28] Maybe this means the rule is now extended to all verbs of motion,
>     that whenever a verb of motion has an object, motion toward that object
>     is assumed. The {-Daq}, we’re told, is optional, and I’m guessing is an
>     ungrammatical usage, like leaving {lu-} off of plural {-lu’} objects or
>     using double negatives in English: people are known to do it, but it’s
>     also recognized as “wrong”. I wouldn’t take it to mean that nouns with
>     Type 5 suffixes can be used as direct objects in general.
>
>   <dt markdown>{X-vo’ vI-Y}
>   <dd markdown>Except for this one, of course. This does fly in the face of
>     everything we thought we knew about direct objects and Type 5 noun
>     suffixes. All I can guess is that this is some special usage peculiar to
>     {-vo’} used with motion verbs. At least, if we want to say {X-vo’ Y
>     vIjaH} “I go from X to Y”, we can still use the same verb prefix! But
>     what, if anything does {X-vo’ jI-Y} now mean? “At a distance from X, I am
>     Y-ing”?
>
>   <dt markdown>{X-Daq jI-Y}
>   <dd markdown>The grammar of this isn’t new, the only innovation is that it
>     is now restricted to mean __only__ some type of movement Y occuring at
>     place X.
> </dl>
>
> So, maybe the new rules in essence are
>
>   1. To indicate motion, use a motion verb with a direct object.
>     1. Motion towards is the default and needs no marker.
>     2. Motion away from needs the marker {-vo’}.
>   2. To indicate location, use a motion verb (or any verb) with a “no object”
>      verb prefix.
>     1. Use {-Daq} for action occuring at the point of reference.
>     2. Use {-vo’} for action occuring at a remove from the point of
>        reference.
>
> If these are correct, then the new rules have actually given us a pretty neat
> new set of tools. It doesn’t change our understanding of locative phrases,
> but adds a way to refine the meanings we can express with {-Daq} and {-vo’}.
>
> An unanswered question is how to use those words which, MO tells us in TKD,
> never require {-Daq}, such as {naDev} or {Dat}. They fit fine in the first
> example: {naDev vIghoS} “I am coming here”, but what about the other uses?
> We’ve encountered {naDevvo’} on the PK tape, and it’s probably still OK, but
> how would you say “I walk in (i.e. while being) here”: {?naDev jIyIt} or

>
> The observant student will note that some of the examples in TKD and
> elsewhere don’t agree with these new rules. One guiding principle of the KLI

## 3.4 The noun-noun construction

> [#commentary-34] I have long believed that the underlying logic of the N1-N2
> construction is that the set of items specified by N2 is restricted to a
> subset specified by N1. This explains not only the possessive use ({yaS taj}
> “the officer’s knife” = “of the universal set of knives, the one which is the
> officer’s”), but also the Genitive ({peQ chem} “magnetic field” = “of the
> universal set of fields, the one pertaining to magnetism”).
>
> [Back](#nouns-34)
>
> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
>
> [#commentary-34b] The difference between N-N possession and apposition is
> that in the former, the more general term comes last, preceded by the more
> specific, while in the latter, the more general term comes first. Also, in
> the former, the two nouns combine to form a new concept, while in the latter,
> the two nouns (or phrases) both refer to different aspects of the same
> concept (that is, “Duras’s sisters” and “Betor and Lursa” both refer to the
> same persons).
>
> [Back](#nouns-34b)


### 4.1.1. Basic prefixes

> [#commentary-411] This is similar to English, where “I give you a book” and
> “I give a book to you” are equivalent. Note that this works only with 1st and
> 2nd person indirect objects, mainly because there’d be no way to distinguish
> direct from indirect object if both were 3rd person.
>
> [Back](#verbs-411)


<!--
### 4.2.4. Cause

> [#commentary-424] The effect of adding {-moH} to an intransitive verb is easy
> to understand: the verb becomes transitive and the original subject becomes
> the object: {poS lojmIt/lojmIt vIpoSmoH} “The door is open(ed)/I open the
> door”. Using {-moH} with verbs which are already transitive is more
> controversial. My personal opinion is that adding {-moH} to any verb opens up
> a new noun slot for the verb. All verbs have subjects (usually), so adding
> {-moH} to an intransitive verb adds an object slot. If a verb is already
> transitive, it already has potential objects, so adding {-moH} doesn’t change
> the objects, but adds a new noun slot, marked with {-vaD}: {matlh Suv
> torgh/torghvaD matlh vISuvmoH} “Torg fights Maltz/I make Torg fight Maltz”.
>
> [Back](#verbs-424)

### 4.2.7. Aspect

> [#commentary-427] A common beginner’s mistake is to assume, when telling a
> story, that since the action of the story is over, all the verbs should have
> {-ta’} or {-pu’}. But these are properly used only when describing action
> completed __at the time of the story__. You should mentally place yourself at
> the time the story is happening. For any given verb, ask yourself if the
> action is completed at that time (a good rule of thumb: if you can use the
> word “already” to describe the action of the verb, it is probably
> perfective). If it is completed, that verb takes the perfective suffix. Since
> most of the verbs in your story are describing events occuring __at__ the
> time of the story, they do not take the perfective.
>
> One source of the confusion about this is that some of the examples in TKD
> itself seem to use {-pu’} as a past-tense marker. In fact, MO has admitted
> that originally, when he was designing the language, {-pu’} was indeed
> intended to be a simple marker of the past tense. But he changed his mind and
> decided to eliminate tense entirely and change {-pu’} to an aspect marker.
> Those examples that seem to indicate simple past slipped past the re-editing
> process.

### 6.2.3. Relative clauses

> or object” [HQ v4n2p5]), but that the Head noun can take any Type 5 noun
> suffix in relation to the main verb of the sentence. When the Head noun is
> the subject or object of the main verb, too, or when it is the first element
> in a N-N construction, it can take {-’e’}. When it has some other
> relationship with the main verb, it can take the appropriate Type 5 Noun
> suffix. (This is still controversial [KLI: W. Martin, 1/27/99, Re: qID; KLI:

>
> This doesn’t solve the “Ship in which I fled” problem: in a sentence like

# [#suffix-e] Commentary: Uses of suffix {-’e’}

The Type 5 noun suffix {-’e’} has been a part of the language from the
beginning, but has never been fully understood. I have recently had some ideas
that could explore more fully some of its properties.

There are three canon examples from TKD illustrating the use of {-’e’}.

  1. {lujpu’ jIH’e’} “I and only I have failed.” TKD 3.3.5 calls this use the
     “topic of the sentence”, and says it is used to emphasize the marked word.

  2. {puqpu’ chaH qama’pu’’e} (TKD 6.3) – This is the classic formula for the
     “to be” sentence when the “subject” of the sentence is a third-person
     noun, in which the two halves of the formula are linked to each other.
     {-’e’} is used in this formula mechanically, as a matter of grammatical
     rule. It’s tempting to consider this formula to be an equational sentence,
     where the nouns on either side of the pronoun are identified with each
     other, but the other example from this section, {pa’DajDaq ghaHtaH la’’e’}
     “The commander is in his quarters” shows that the subject of the sentence
     can have other relationships with the rest of the sentence (in this case,
     {pa’DajDaq} is adverbial).

  3. {HaqwI’’e’ DaH yISam.} (TKD Addendum 6.7) “Find the SURGEON now!” Contrary
     to normal Klingon grammar, the object of the verb has been placed before
     the adverb, and has been “topicalized” with the suffix {-’e’}.

  4. Moving away from TKD examples, the only other common use of {-’e’} is to
     disambiguate subject from object in {-bogh} phrases, eg. {HoD’e’ leghbogh
     yaS} “The captain whom the officer saw” (and not \*“The officer who saw
     the captain”). Although this usage originated in fan circles
     (specifically, HoD Qanqor), it was later endorsed by Marc Okrand and so is
     now also considered canon. Note that in this case, what is being marked is
     the “head noun” of the relative clause, that is, the noun referenced by
     the rest of the sentence; its role as subject or object of either the
     outer sentence or the relative clause is not changed.

The suffix {-’e’} is unusual among Type 5 suffixes, in that it can be applied
to nouns that can also be the subject or object of the main (or relative) verb
of the sentence; all other Type 5 suffixes put the nouns to which they are
affixed in the “something else” category of nouns that act in a prepositional
way in the sentence. But if we consider {-’e’} as a true Type 5 suffix, then we
need to ask if there is some role in the “something else” category that a noun
with {-’e’} could play in a sentence. After all, in the examples above, two (ex
1 & 4) use {-’e’} on nouns which are also subjects or objects of a verb, but
ex. 2 does not, and, I will argue, neither does ex. 3. Instead, I think they
illustrate the use of {-’e’} to mark the “something else” category of *focus*.
In other words, although Okrand consistently describes the suffix {-’e’} as
marking the topic of the sentence, much of the time, it is really marking
focus, and that allows us to extend its focus-marking function into other
territory, as well.

Although there is some fuzziness amoung linguists in the definition of focus
(Payne, pp266ff), the concensus is that the focus of a sentence introduces new
information into the utterance. The focus of the sentence need not be the
subject or the object of the main verb, but simply draws attention to something
new in the sentence. In the example {HaqwI’’e’ DaH yISam}, is it possible to
think of the noun {HaqwI’’e’} as focus, and not actually as the object of
{yISam} at all. This would neatly explain why it can come before the adverb
{DaH}. In this interpretation, the sentence would be read “as for a surgeon,
find (one) now!” That this is a new focus would be derived from the context of
the sentence: presumably the notion of needing to find a surgeon had not
previously come up. Indeed, the whole notion of “emphasis” is a kind of focus
operation, introducing into the context of the sentence the new idea that a
particular noun is especially important. Moreover, Okrand gives alternative
translations of the examples from 6.3 that clearly show a role as focus, and
not as subject, eg. “as for the commander, he is in his quarters.”

If the focus of a phrase can be a true Type 5 noun, then this has some useful
implications, namely in freeing us from having to rely on the categories of
subject and object to convey everything useful we might want to say about a
noun and its relation to a verb. The most immediate use that comes to mind is
to tell what a sentence is “about”, especially with intransitive verbs: {Duj’e’
qaS vay’} “Something’s happening with the ship.”; {Qu’lIj’e’ nom yIvang}
“Quickly carry out your mission!”

It could also be a way to indicate the “subject” of phrases that would be
otherwise too confusing to follow: {vav’e’ nargh SoS SuchmeH ’eb} “It is too
late for Father to visit Mother.” (and not {\*nargh SoS SuchmeH vav ’eb}, with
the confusing pair of final nouns), or to indicate the “subject” of
constructions that don’t actually have subjects: {moQbara’’e’ jIH po’ law’ SoH
po’ puS} “I am more skilled than you at martial arts.” (as a substitute for the
more unwieldy {moQbara’ wIqeltaHvIS/wIbuStaHvIS}).

The use of the suffix {-’e’} in Type 5 noun relationships other than with
subject or object in order to mark focus I believe is justified by canon
examples, and would give Klingon a little more flexibility in its expressions.

# [#suffix-moh] Commentary: Use of verb suffix {-moH}

This page proposes a theory which attempts to predict the behavior of the Type
5 verb suffix {-moH} and give a rationale for its behavior. My theory hinges on
the principle of a hierarchy of semantic roles that nouns can play in relation
to verbs in the Klingon sentence, in the order ***actor-object-indirect
object***. These roles are embodied in the parts of speech (in order) of
*subject, object* and *benefactor* (which is expressed in Klingon by the Type 5
noun suffix {-vaD}). All verbs have at least one associated role, the subject.
The addition of the suffix {-moH} adds a new actor to the verb phrase, causing
the original actor to move to the next __empty__ slot in the phrase.

We seem to have pretty good concensus on what happens when {-moH} is added to
an intransitive verb: the original actor moves to the next unoccupied slot in
the verb phrase, the object. Example: {pIl loD} ‘the man is inspired’ > {loD
pIlmoH be’} ‘the woman inspires the man’ (== ‘the woman causes the man to be
inspired’).

But what happens with transitive verbs, which already have filled object slots?
(Let me note here that transitive verbs are those which carry the implication
of an object to complete their meaning, whether the object is actually present
or not.) I assert that the original actor is again displaced, but this time not
to the object slot, which is already filled (at least potentially), but to the
next empty slot, the indirect object, marked in Klingon by the suffix {-vaD}.
Example: {tlhIngan Hol ghoj loD} ‘the man learns Klingon’ > {loDvaD tlhIngan
Hol ghojmoH be’} ‘the woman teaches the man Klingon’. Since we are taking about
roles filled at the lexical level of the verb, there is no change in this
construction if the object is not actually present: {loDvaD ghojmoH be’} ‘the
woman teaches the man’. (What would you do with a verb that already has an
indirect object? I personally would switch to a phrase: {loDvaD paq nob be’}
‘the woman gives the book to the man’ > {loDvaD paq nob be’ ’e’ vIraD} ‘I make
the woman give the book to the man’.)

Although the theory behind this behavior is my invention, I did not make up the
behavior, but based it on the canon phrase {ghaHvaD quHDaj qawmoH Ha’quj} ‘his
sash reminds him of his heritage.’ [Skybox card 20] (< {?quHDaj qaw ghaH} ‘he
remembers his heritage’). The theory is an attempt to explain why it is so.

It turns out I didn’t invent the idea of a hierarchy of roles, either. I
discovered that the theory I had intuited is an actual linguistic principle
called a valence increasing operation. According to this theory, every verb has
a natural set of actors (every verb has at least one, the subject!), and many
languages have ways to add more actors to a verb phrase. Adding a causative
meaning (in Klingon, by adding the suffix {-moH}) to an intransitive verb
increases the number of participants, and thus the valence, from one to two;
adding it to a transitive verb increases valence from two to three.

Another interesting linguistic principle may shed light on why the subjects of
transitive and intransitive verbs behave differently with {-moH}. In an
intransitive verb, the subject doesn’t play the same role as the subject of a
transitive verb. The subject of a transitive verb is a true actor, sometimes
called an agent, who directs the action of the verb to some target, the object.
The subject of an intransitive verb is really the experiencer of the verb and
not an agent (in {poS lojmIt}, the door is closed, experiences being closed,
but it didn’t close itself). Thus, the subject of an intransitive verb has more
in common with the object of a transitive verb than it does with its subject.
In fact, languages called *ergative/absolute* languages treat the subject of
intransitive verbs grammatically like an object of a transitive verb (eg., by
giving them the same case markings), and reserve a different grammatical form
for the subject of a transitive verb. Adding {-moH} to the intransitive verb
introduces a true actor, the new subject, an agent who performs the action on
the experiencer. It’s easy for the experiencer to slip into the role of object
since it’s already halfway there semantically and there is no existing object
of the original intransitive verb to block it.

Actually, there is no inherent reason why the third role should be the indirect
object; the valence principle only speaks of a more peripheral role for the
original actor (sometimes called the *causee*, as opposed to the new actor, the
*causer*). But our canon example above uses {-vaD}, so evidently the causee
moves into the “benefactor” role in Klingon. Interestingly, this is fairly
common in several Terran languages, such as Turkish and Quechua, and is called
a **dative-shift**, although, of course, there is no reason why this should be
relevant to Klingon. But the valence principle does specify that the causer
becomes the new subject of the verb, and that the object does not change its
role.

I should note for completeness that there are at least two other canon
sentences that use a transitive verb with {-moH} (eg. {HIQoymoH} ‘Cause me to
hear it!’ [TKD 4.2.4]), which may contradict our canon example cited here, but
these are inconclusive. They don’t have stated objects or ‘compelled actors’,
and so the ‘prefix trick’ may be obscuring the grammatical pattern being used.
Another alternative sometimes discussed, that every verb behaves differently
with {-moH} depending on its lexical meaning, sometimes casting the original
subject as a new object, sometimes as a ‘compelled actor’ with {-vaD} or other
Type 5 suffixes, I consider pointless to consider, mainly because concensus
would never be possible, and so the rule becomes as useless as having no rule
at all.

If language is about communication, and if users of Klingon want to treat it as
a real language, then standards must be accepted and made easily applicable.
This is especially true with a community such as the Klingon language
community: numerically small, geographically scattered, and with no pool of
native speakers as final arbiters of correct use. Otherwise, it is likely that
we will simply degenerate into isolated speakers of our own mutually
unintelligible dialects. I suggest that my theory of {-moH}, which predicts the
behavior of both transitive and intransitive verbs, agrees with canon and has a
coherent principle behind it to explain the behavior, could be a good standard
to apply when using this suffix.
