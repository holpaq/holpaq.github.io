<font size="-1">Last updated 7/17/99</font></p><p>

<a name="intro"></a>This page is an attempt to collect in one place all the addenda, corrections, 
clarifications and accepted conventions for <strong><font color="#DD3615">tlhIngan Hol</font></strong> that have appeared
since the publication of <em>The Klingon Dictionary</em> in 1992.  The entries are
keyed to the section numbers of TKD, and each entry includes the original
source of the addendum (if possible).  In order to avoid copyright infringement, and to encourage
you to seek out the sources,
the entries are paraphrased, rather than quoted directly.  Don't consider this page to be a
substitute for the originals; every serious student should own the original texts, if only to
see how accurately I've interpreted them.
</p><p>
Within each section, the entries are classified under one of three degrees
of reliability: Those in <strong>bold type</strong> represent direct statements from Marc
Okrand (the language's creator and only source of canon), those in 
<code>plain
type</code> represent grammar inferred from canon examples but not directly
addressed by Marc Okrand (I defer to the members of the Klingon Language Institute
and its associated mailing list for the interpretation of these canon
examples), and those in <em>italic type</em> represent the accepted usages of the
KLI and its members, while recognizing that these usages have no canonical 
standing (there is some overlap between these last two categories,
since hopefully we base our usage on canon). 
Finally, you can read my own commentaries on a given topic
by clicking on the <a href="kliaddc.html">Commentary</a> link. 
</p><p>
You the reader should consider <strong>bold</strong> entries to be as authoritative as TKD
itself, <code>plain</code> entries to be reliable but not set in 
stone, and <em>italic</em>
entries primarily as unofficial guides to good usage.  My own commentaries, 
of course, are my opinions only and should be given no more weight
than they deserve.
</p><p>
A final note: This page is concerned only with grammar.  It does not
consider any lexical topics, such as the transitivity of a given verb
or new or expanded meanings for existing words, unless specifically related to a more general
point of grammar.  
</p><p>
I want this page to be as accurate and inclusive as possible, so if I've
omitted something or stated it wrongly, please 
<a href="mailto:teresh@tdonnelly.org">e-mail</a> me with the 
correction.

1.1 Consonants<p>
</p><ol>
<li><em><strong><font color="#DD3615">Q</font></strong> is pronounced [q_X] 
(in X-SAMPA phonetic transcription), or basically like an
     aspirated <strong><font color="#DD3615">q</font></strong>, that is, 
<strong><font color="#DD3615">q</font></strong> followed closely by a raspy puff of air</em> [KLI: M. Shoulson, 2/20/98, Re:
Introduction]<p>
</p></li><li><strong>Doubled letters are pronounced either as a lengthening of the letter, or with a brief
     break between the two letters.  Some speakers incorrectly pronounce the double letter as a
     single letter; this is especially true for <font color="#DD3615">''</font> (two glottal
     stops).</strong>  [KGT, p.138]

3.1 Complex nouns<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2.1 Compound Nouns<p>
</p><blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don't assume that any naked verb can be used as a noun, 
     just because some can.</strong> [HQ v3n3p11]<p>
</p></li><li><em>Don't try to break compound nouns into parts and use the parts either alone or in other
compounds.</em> [KLI: A. Anderson, 4/13/97, Re: SopDaq]<p>
<a name="321"></a>
</p></li><li><em>Don't coin new compound words from existing parts.</em> [KLI: D. Trimboli, 11/30/96, Re:
     KLBC: Re: This message is too long]<br>
<center><a href="kliaddc.html#321">Commentary</a></center>
</li></ol>
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2.2 Verb plus <strong><font color="#DD3615">-wI'</font></strong>
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<li>In reference to inanimate objects, this suffix
means "thing which does" (<strong><font color="#DD3615">joqwI'</font></strong>) or
     "thing which is used for" 
(<strong><font color="#DD3615">nanwI'</font></strong>). [TKD, KGT]<p> 
<a name="322"></a>
</p></li><li>In reference to animate beings, this suffix
means "one who does" (<strong><font color="#DD3615">baHwI'</font></strong>) or "one
     who is" (<strong><font color="#DD3615">pujwI'</font></strong>). [TKD]<br>
<center><a href="kliaddc.html#322">Commentary</a></center>
</li></ol>
</blockquote>


3.3 Suffixes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3.1 Augmentative/diminutive
<p></p><blockquote>
<a name="331"></a>
<em>These suffixes are not simply equivalent to <strong><font color="#DD3615">tIn/mach</font></strong>, but create a new concept, often
     requiring an entirely different English word to translate, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">loD / loDHom</font></strong> "man /boy",
     <strong><font color="#DD3615">bIQ/bIQ'a'</font></strong> "water/ocean".</em> [TKD]<br>

<center><a href="kliaddc.html#331">Commentary</a></center>
</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3.2 Number
<p></p><blockquote>
<a name="332"></a>
<em>The plural of <strong><font color="#DD3615">porgh</font></strong> is probably <strong><font color="#DD3615">porghmey</font></strong> (and that of <strong><font color="#DD3615">lom</font></strong>, <strong><font color="#DD3615">lommey</font></strong>); most
     likely, <strong><font color="#DD3615">-Du'</font></strong> is used only for body parts,
     not the body itself.</em> [ KLI: R. Stewart, 11/16/97,
Re: KLBC tlhIngan yot 'ay' cha'DIch;
KLI: R. Stewart, 11/26/96; Re: KLBC Plurals]<br>

<center><a href="kliaddc.html#332">Commentary</a></center>
</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3.4 Possession/specification
<p></p><blockquote>
<strong>A "being capable of using language" must be a true living being (not a talking computer,
     for example) and must have an inherent capacity for speech (which may not be manifested,
     in the case of infants or someone who has lost the
     power of speech).</strong> [KLI: S. Boozer,
     7/12/98, Anecdotal Okrand]
</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3.5 Syntactic markers
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<li><strong><strong><font color="#DD3615">-Daq</font></strong>
and <strong><font color="#DD3615">-vo'</font></strong> are 
strictly locative; they refer only to
     <u>motion</u>, or <u>location</u>.
     They can't be used in other situations in which English uses
     "to", "in" or "from" in a metaphorical sense (eg. "I translate from English to Klingon";
     you can't use <strong><font color="#DD3615">-Daq</font></strong>
     for "to" or <strong><font color="#DD3615">-vo'</font></strong>
     for "from").</strong> [HQ v8n1p7]<p>
</p></li><li><strong>Some prepositional concepts in English are verbs
in Klingon: eg.
     <strong><font color="#DD3615">tlhej</font></strong> for "with", both in the sense of "accompanying" and 
     "doing something together with", eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">Dargh vItlhutlh 'ej mutlhej torgh</font></strong> "Torg drinks tea  
     with me."</strong> [HQ v2n4p18 ].<p>
<a name="3353"></a>
</p></li><li><em>It seems that a noun with a Type 5 suffix can modify a
single noun (as opposed to
     whole sentences), eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">ghe''orDaq
     luSpet</font></strong> "a black hole in the Netherworld".</em> [PK, BOP]<br>
<center><a href="kliaddc.html#3353">Commentary</a></center><p>
<a name="335"></a>
</p></li><li><strong>Verbs of motion have different meanings when used with and without <strong><font color="#DD3615">-Daq</font></strong> and
     object prefixes:<br>
        </strong><ul><strong>
          <li><strong><font color="#DD3615">X(-Daq) vI-Y</font></strong> "I Y to X" (<strong><font color="#DD3615">-Daq</font></strong> is optional);

          </li></strong><li><strong><strong><font color="#DD3615">X-Daq
          jI-Y</font></strong> "I Y at/on/in X".</strong><br>

</li><li>The use of suffix <strong><font color="#DD3615">-'e'</font></strong>: <a href="kligrame.html">Commentary</a>
</li></ol>
</blockquote>

3.4 The noun-noun construction
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<a name="34"></a>
<li>This construction doesn't just show possession, but is also used as the grammatical
Genitive. That is, it forms phrases that are equivalent
     to English adjectives of
     origin <strong><font color="#DD3615">romuluS HIq</font></strong>,
     composition <strong><font color="#DD3615">peQ chem</font></strong>,
     or location
<strong><font color="#DD3615">tlhIngan wo'</font></strong>. [HQ v3n3p6]<br>
<center><a href="kliaddc.html#34">Commentary</a></center><p>
</p></li><li>Multiple N-N-N(-N...) formations are allowed. eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">SuvwI' qa' patlh</font></strong> "a warrior's level of
spiritual attainment"  [S33]<p>
<a name="34b"></a>
</p></li><li>Noun apposition, different from the N-N construction, is allowed, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">DuraS be'nI'pu'
     be'etor lurSa' je</font></strong> "Duras's sisters, Betor and
     Lursa" [S26; HQ v3n1p5]<br>
<center><a href="kliaddc.html#34b">Commentary</a></center><p>
</p></li><li>Nouns representing locative prepositional concepts, such
as <strong><font color="#DD3615">retlh, bIng, botlh</font></strong>, etc.,
when used with pronouns, follow the pronoun in a N-N formation,
     and the pronoun suffixes are not used, 
eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">jIH retlhDaq</font></strong> "alongside me", not   
     *<strong><font color="#DD3615">retlhwIjDaq</font></strong> [KGT, p. 24]

</p><h3>4. Verbs</h3>
4.1 Pronominal prefixes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1.1. Basic prefixes<p>
</p><blockquote>
<a name="411"></a>
<strong>The prefix trick: When a verb has a first or second person
     indirect object (marked with <strong><font color="#DD3615">-vaD</font></strong>), and a third-person
     object or no object, the indirect object can be shown by using
     a verb prefix whose object is the appropriate person: eg.
     <strong><font color="#DD3615">SoHvaD paq vInob</font></strong> = <strong><font color="#DD3615">paq qanob</font></strong> "I give you a book"; <strong><font color="#DD3615">HInob</font></strong> "Give it to me!"
     </strong>[MSN, 6/97]
<br>

</blockquote>

4.2. Verb suffixes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2.1 Oneself/One another<p>
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Imperatives with stative verbs require the extra suffixes <strong><font color="#DD3615">-'eghmoH</font></strong>, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">yItuj'eghmoH</font></strong>
     "Warm yourself!"</strong> [KGT p.117]<p>
</p></blockquote>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2.4. Cause <a href="kligramm.html">Commentary</a>
<!--p><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME=424></A>
When adding <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>-moH</STRONG></FONT>
to transitives, you can use
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>-vaD</STRONG></FONT> to
     indicate the noun compelled to act,
     eg. <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>ghaHvaD quHDaj qawmoH (Ha'quj)</STRONG></FONT> "His sash
reminds him of his heritage"
(literally "The sash causes-to-remember his-heritage to-him" [S20]<br>
<CENTER><A HREF="kliaddc.html#424">Commentary</A></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE-->
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2.5. Indefinite subject/ability
</p><p></p><blockquote>
<strong>The verb prefix <strong><font color="#DD3615">lu-</font></strong> when used with the
indefinite suffix <strong><font color="#DD3615">-lu'</font></strong> and with plural objects is
     often omitted, especially in equivalents to
     English "There is/are" sentences, although this is
somewhat ungrammatical, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">naDev tlhInganpu' tu'lu'</font></strong> "There
are Klingons here"</strong> [KGT p.
171; HQ v7n3p4]
</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2.7. Aspect
<p></p><blockquote>
<a name="427"></a>
<strong>The perfective suffixes <strong><font color="#DD3615">-pu'/-ta'</font></strong> do not indicate past tense.  Klingon has no tenses.  They
     indicate action completed in the time context of the rest of the 
discourse.  The time context may be present, past or future.</strong> [CK;
     HQ v2n1p10;  HQ v2n4p11]<br>
<center><a href="kliaddc.html#427">Commentary</a></center>
</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2.9. Syntactic markers
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<li><strong>The placement of verbs with <strong><font color="#DD3615">-jaj</font></strong> in the sentence depends on the type of sentence:
     with formal toasts, the order of the sentence is O-S-V, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">'IwlIj jachjaj</font></strong> "May your blood
scream" , but in regular sentences, it
     is the
     usual O-V-S, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">jejjaj tajlIj</font></strong> "May your knife be sharp."</strong>
     [KGT. p.25]<p>
</p></li><li>Verbs with <strong><font color="#DD3615">-jaj</font></strong> may take Type 7 aspect suffixes (<em>contra</em> TKD), eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">wo' DevtaHjaj
     ghawran</font></strong> [KGT, p. 25]<p>
<a name="429"></a>
</p></li><li><strong>Verbs with <strong><font color="#DD3615">-ghach</font></strong> are very rare and highly marked.  These
     nominalized verbs are not generally the equivalent of simple
     nouns, but of abstracts and process nouns (those in English with
     suffixes like <em>-ness, -tion</em>), so most examples require another 
     verb suffix in addition to <strong><font color="#DD3615">-ghach</font></strong>, such
     as <strong><font color="#DD3615">-taH</font></strong>.  These nominalized verbs never 
     take subject/object prefixes.</strong> [HQ v3n3p10]<br>
<center><a href="kliaddc.html#429">Commentary</a></center>
</li></ol></blockquote>

4.4. Adjectives
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<a name="44"></a>
<li><strong>When a noun has more than one adjective, one of the following forms is used: <strong><font color="#DD3615">SuD
     Dargh 'ej wov</font></strong> or <strong><font color="#DD3615">SuDbogh Dargh 'ej wovbogh</font></strong></strong> [KGT p.82]<br>
     <center><a href="kliaddc.html#44">Commentary</a></center><p>
<a name="44b"></a>
</p></li><li><em>Descriptive verbs used adjectivally (i.e. after the noun) we have seen take only the
     suffixes <strong><font color="#DD3615">-qu'</font></strong> (<strong><font color="#DD3615">tInqu'</font></strong>),
     <strong><font color="#DD3615">-Ha'</font></strong> (<strong><font color="#DD3615">ngaDHa'</font></strong>)

</p><h3>5. Other kinds of words</h3>
5.2 Numbers
<blockquote><ol>

<a name="52"></a>
<li>Most quantity words appear to behave like numbers and come
    before the  noun: <strong><font color="#DD3615">Hoch X</font></strong> (<strong>Note: <strong><font color="#DD3615">Hoch X</font></strong> plus singular noun = 
     "each X"; plus plural noun = "all the Xs"</strong>) [HQ v5n2p11],
    <strong><font color="#DD3615">'op X</font></strong> "some Xs" [S7], <strong><font color="#DD3615">latlh X</font></strong> "(an)other X/Xs" [S31], <strong><font color="#DD3615">bID X</font></strong> "half an X, a half X"
[BOP]
<br>
<center><a href="kliaddc.html#52">Commentary</a></center><p>

</p></li><li>When <strong><font color="#DD3615">Hoch</font></strong> follows the noun, it appears to refer to the entirety of the noun, eg
     <strong><font color="#DD3615">nIn Hoch natlhlu'pu'</font></strong> "All the fuel is used up" [KGT p. 155]<p> 
<a name="52b"></a>
</p></li><li>The quantity word <strong><font color="#DD3615">HochHom</font></strong> appears to come after the noun
     [S15]
<br>
<center><a href="kliaddc.html#52b">Commentary</a></center><p>

</p></li><li>Number phrases with <strong><font color="#DD3615">vatlhvI'</font></strong> are considered numbers and come before the noun, eg.
<strong><font color="#DD3615">cha'maH vagh vatlhvI' Hong</font></strong> "One quarter impulse power". [ ST5; KLI: S. Boozer, 5/21/99,
Re: vatlhvI']<p>
</p></li><li><em>Type 5 noun suffixes come after a noun + ordinal number or
     noun + number label phrase: <strong><font color="#DD3615">Duj wejDIchDaq</font></strong> "In the third ship";
     <strong><font color="#DD3615">Duj wejDaq</font></strong> "in Ship No. 3"</em> [HQ v5n1p17]<p>
</p></li></ol></blockquote>

5.4 Adverbials
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<li>One can use <strong><font color="#DD3615">-Ha'</font></strong> to form the opposite of some adverbs, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">Do'Ha'</font></strong> [HQ v4n4p11;
     KGT, p. 148]<p>
</p></li><li><strong>Time stamps simply come at the head of the sentence, and require no special marking.
     They can be combined to convey more precise times, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">DISvam</font></strong> "this year", <strong><font color="#DD3615">wej
     Hu'</font></strong> "3 days ago", <strong><font color="#DD3615">DaHjaj po</font></strong> "this morning"</strong> [MSN, 6/30/97]<p>
</p></li><li><em>Duration stamps must be rendered by verb phrases, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">qaStaHvIS wej rep</font></strong> "for three
     hours", <strong><font color="#DD3615">nI'taHvIS poH</font></strong> "for a long time"</em> [KLI: D.
     Trimboli, 11/5/98, Re: KLBC yu'wI';
     KLI: M. Shoulson, 7/28/97, Re: KLBC + And now, the news]<p>
<a name="54"></a>
</p></li><li>Ordinals may be used as a kind of time stamp indicating number of distinct events,
     eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">wa'DIch  tlhIngan Dujmey luleghlu'pu'bogh...</font></strong> "Klingon ships seen for the first time..."
[S15]
<br>
<center><a href="kliaddc.html#54">Commentary</a></center><br>
</li></ol></blockquote>

5.6 Names and address
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<a name="56"></a>
<li>Names can be stated in a couple of ways: <strong><font color="#DD3615">X-vaD Y ponglu'</font></strong> "X is called Y" [S27]; and
<strong><font color="#DD3615">X 'oH pongwIj'e'</font></strong> "X is my name" [FAQ]
<br>
<center><a href="kliaddc.html#56">Commentary</a></center><br>
</li><li><strong>The full form of address for a Klingon is <strong><font color="#DD3615">worIv, mogh puqloD, martaq tuq</font></strong> "Worf, son
     of Mog, of the House of Martok". Except in the most formal circumstances, it is proper
     to address a Klingon by the first name only.</strong> [KGT p.197;
     MSN, 9/8/97]<p>
</p></li><li><strong>Titles follow names, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">tlha'a HoD</font></strong> "Captain
Klaa"</strong> [KGT p.5]<p>
</p></li><li>Geographical regions seem to follow this same formula, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">Sa'Qej Sep</font></strong> "Sakrej
     Region" [KGT, p.16]

</p><h2>Klingon Grammar Addenda</h2>
<font size="-1" color="#FF00FF">Key:</font>
<font size="-1"><strong>Spoken by Okrand</strong>
| Inferred from canon |
<em>Accepted usage</em></font><p>
</p><h3>6. Syntax</h3>
6.1. Basic Sentences
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<li><strong>Some complex sentences in English will be rendered as two or
     more simpler sentences in Klingon</strong> [HQ v3n1p3; HQ v4n2p5]<p>
</p></li><li>Impersonal sentences ("It" sentences, where "it" doesn't refer to anything specific) seem to
     be allowed, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">SIS</font></strong> "It's raining" [KLI: S.
     Boozer, 7/12/98, Anecdotal Okrand]<p>
</p></li></ol></blockquote>

6.2. Complex sentences<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2.1. Compound sentences
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<li><strong>The conjunction <strong><font color="#DD3615">'ej</font></strong> merely indicates the (simultaneous?) occurence of two events; there
     is no time sequence implied, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">mabom 'ej matlhutlh</font></strong> "We sing and we drink", not *"We
sing and then drink"</strong> [MSN, 3/20/98]<p>
</p></li><li>Sequence seems to be indicated by the lack of a conjunction, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">bogh tlhInganpu',
SuvwI'pu' moj, Hegh</font></strong> "Klingons are born, become warriors, then die."; <strong><font color="#DD3615">beyHom bey bey'a'
jachtaH</font></strong> "They are letting out an ever-louder howl." [TKW, p5; S31]<p>
</p></li><li>The "sentence" conjunctions can be used with verbal phrases as well as complete
     sentences, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">SuvmeH 'ej charghmeH bogh tlhInganpu'</font></strong> [TKW, p 5, et al.]
<p></p></li></ol></blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2.3. Relative clauses
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<li><strong>You can mark the head noun of a relative phrase (subject
     or object of the <strong><font color="#DD3615">-bogh</font></strong> verb) with <strong><font color="#DD3615">-'e'</font></strong>: <strong><font color="#DD3615">HoD'e' qIpta'bogh
     yaS vIlegh</font></strong> "I see the captain who was hit by the officer"
     (not "I see the officer who hit the captain").</strong> [HQ v1n3p4]<p>
<a name="623"></a>
</p></li><li>You may be able to use any Type 5 suffix to mark the head noun of
     a relative phrase: <strong><font color="#DD3615">meQtaHbogh qachDaq Suv qoH neH</font></strong> "Only
     a fool fights in a burning house". [TKW, p.111; S99]<br>
     <center><a href="kliaddc.html#623">Commentary</a></center><p>

</p></li><li><em>Headless relatives (i.e., relative <strong><font color="#DD3615">-bogh</font></strong> words with no expressed subject or object, eg.
*<strong><font color="#DD3615">SuHeghbogh</font></strong> "You who are dying") are probably not
allowed.</em> [FAQ; HQ v1n3p5]<p>
</p></li></ol></blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2.4. Purpose clauses
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<a name="6241"></a>
<li>Verbs with <strong><font color="#DD3615">-meH</font></strong> can modify nouns as well as verbs, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">pe'meH taj</font></strong>
     "cutting knife". 
They are able to take actual subjects and/or objects.
[HQ v7n3p6; HQ v7n2p14; KGT, p.63]<br>
    <center><a href="kliaddc.html#6241">Commentary</a></center><p>
<a name="6242"></a>
</p></li><li><em>Such verbs can be used to express Sentences as Subjects, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">nargh qaSuchmeH 'eb</font></strong>
     "the opportunity to visit you has passed".</em> [HQ v7n2p14]<br>
    <center><a href="kliaddc.html#6242">Commentary</a></center><p>  
<a name="624"></a>
</p></li><li>Verbs with <strong><font color="#DD3615">-meH</font></strong> must take verb prefixes, if only the 3-rd person zero-prefix,  when
appropriate. [HQ v8n2p12]<br>
    <center><a href="kliaddc.html#624">Commentary</a></center><p>
</p></li></ol></blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2.5. Sentences as Objects
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<li><em>Adverbs with <strong><font color="#DD3615">'e'</font></strong>
come after the object sentence and before
     the <strong><font color="#DD3615">'e'</font></strong>,
     eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">paw Duj wej 'e' vIlegh</font></strong>
     "I haven't seen
     the ship arrive yet".</em> [HQ
     v1n2p11]<p>  
</p></li><li>The object pronoun <strong><font color="#DD3615">'e'</font></strong> can refer to an entire  previous sentence: <strong><font color="#DD3615">'e' neHbe' vavwI'</font></strong>
     "That (i.e., some previous sentence) isn't what
     my father wanted" [ST6].<p>
</p></li><li><strong>The verb <strong><font color="#DD3615">jatlh</font></strong> can take an object, but only a noun describing a language (eg.
     <strong><font color="#DD3615">tlhIngan Hol</font></strong>) or speech event (eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">SoQ</font></strong>).  For reported speech, the quotation is not
     the object of <strong><font color="#DD3615">jatlh</font></strong>, and <strong><font color="#DD3615">jatlh</font></strong> will take the "no object" verb prefixes, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">jIghung
     jIjatlh</font></strong> "I say I am hungry" (literally "I
     am hungry. I say (that)").</strong> [MSN, 6/30/97]<p>
</p></li><li><strong>The only true verbs of speech are <strong><font color="#DD3615">jatlh</font></strong> and <strong><font color="#DD3615">ja'</font></strong>.  English allows many verbs to be
     used as verbs of speech, but in Klingon, these would be multiple sentences, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">jIjach.
     jIjatlh yImev</font></strong> "I shouted 'Stop'!" (literally "I shout.
     I speak. 'Stop!'").</strong> [HQ v7n4p4]<p>
</p></li></ol></blockquote>
  
6.4. Questions
<p></p><blockquote><ol>
<a name="64"></a>
<li><strong>We have no indirect question/relative adverbs and thus no way to directly express
     Questions as Objects, and must recast them</strong>.
	[HQ v6n4p12; KLI:
     S. Boozer, 7/12/98, Anecdotal Okrand]<br>
     <center><a href="kliaddc.html#64">Commentary</a></center><p>
</p></li><li><strong>We have no word for the question word "which" and must recast the sentence, eg.
     <strong><font color="#DD3615">nuH DaneHbogh yIngu'</font></strong> "Which weapon do you want?" (literally "Identify the weapon
     which you want!").</strong> [KGT, p105; KLI: K. Traft, 12/15/96, Dr. Okrand Speaks -- lengthy]
<p></p></li></ol></blockquote><p>

6.6. Comparatives and superlatives
</p><p></p><blockquote>
What can fill the slots of the <strong><font color="#DD3615">A Q law'/B Q puS</font></strong> construction:<p>
  </p><ol>
  <li><strong><font color="#DD3615">A</font></strong> and <strong><font color="#DD3615">B</font></strong> can be any noun or noun
  phrase, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">targhwIj yab tIn law' no'lI' Hoch yabDu'
tIn puS</font></strong>. [PK]<p>
  </p></li><li>Noun and verb phrases can precede the entire
  construction, eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">reH latlh qabDaq qul
     tuj law', Hoch tuj puS</font></strong>; <strong><font color="#DD3615">tlhutlhmeH HIq
     ngeb qaq law' bIQ qaq puS</font></strong>  [PK; HQ v2n2p3;
TKW p75 ]<p>
   </p></li><li><strong><strong><font color="#DD3615">A</font></strong> and <strong><font color="#DD3615">B</font></strong> can be pronouns</strong> [HQ v4n2p3]<p>
</p></li><li><strong>Other contrastive pairs can replace <strong><font color="#DD3615">law'/puS</font></strong>,
eg. <strong><font color="#DD3615">HoS/puj</font></strong>.</strong> [KGT p.178]<p>
</p></li><li>Only descriptive verbs can fill the <strong><font color="#DD3615">Q</font></strong> slot, and then only in a predicate fashion, so you
          must use some other formula for other types of comparisions, such as sentences with <strong><font color="#DD3615">nIv</font></strong>
or <strong><font color="#DD3615">-qu'</font></strong>,
eg. <strong><strong><font color="#DD3615">bortaS nIvqu' 'oH bortaS'e'</font></strong> "Revenge is the
best revenge"</strong>; <em><strong><font color="#DD3615">jach yaS 'ach jachqu'
HoD</font></strong> "The captain shouts louder than the officer."</em>  [HQ v4n3p15; TKW, p 121, et al].

</p><h3>Appendix: A Selected List of Useful Klingon Expressions</h3>
<ol>
<a name="ab"></a>
<li><strong>Telling time: Hours are expressed in 24-hour time.  Generally, you can "ask" the time with
     the phrase <font color="#DD3615">rep yIper</font> "Label the hour!" .  You answer with a time label: <font color="#DD3615">rep wej</font> "three
     A.M."; <font color="#DD3615">rep cha'maH</font> "20 hours (i.e. 8 P.M.)"; <font color="#DD3615">rep loS wejmaH</font> "4:30 A.M."  You can
     also use the phrase 
<font color="#DD3615">'arlogh Qoylu'pu'</font>"How many times has it 
(<em>a signal bell, maybe</em>) been
     heard?". This can be augmented with other elements, eg., <font color="#DD3615">mamejDI' 'arlogh Qoylu'pu'</font>
     "What time do we leave?" You answer with the number of 
times: <font color="#DD3615">cha'logh</font> "two
     o'clock".</strong> [SK, 2/3/99]<br>
     <center><a href="kliaddc.html#ab">Commentary</a></center><p>
</p></li><li><strong>Similes are expressed by a phrase with an adjective and a following metaphorical
     phrase, eg. <font color="#DD3615">puj SuvwI'vetlh; bIQ rur</font> "That warrior is as weak as
     water".</strong> [KGT, p.127]<p>
</p></li><li><strong>Color terms can be made more specific by additional adjectives or by the simile method
     shown above, eg. <font color="#DD3615">SuD 'ej wov</font> "yellow"; <font color="#DD3615">Doq 'ej Qaj wuS rur</font> "Kraj-lip red" or "brown";  
     <font color="#DD3615">Doqqu'</font> "deep red".</strong> [KGT p.82; HQ v8n1p7]<p>


</p></li><li><strong>Age is expressed by the formula <font color="#DD3615"># ben jIboghpu'</font> "I am # years old" (literally "I was
     born # years ago"); as a question, it
     is <font color="#DD3615">ben 'ar bIboghpu'</font></strong> [SK, 12/15/96]<p>
<a name="aa"></a>
</p></li><li><strong>The verbs <font color="#DD3615">Sum/Hop</font> generally refer to location in relation to the speaker, ex., <font color="#DD3615">Sum
     raS</font> "The table is near to me".  To change the referent of the verb, you can use <font color="#DD3615">-Daq</font>,
     eg., <font color="#DD3615">yaSDaq Sum raS</font> "The table is near the officer".</strong>

<h3>Commentaries</h3>
<font size="-1">You might wonder what qualifies me to put this list together.  Well, I'll let you decide if
I'm qualified; I'll just give you my credentials.  I've been studying Klingon since the revised 
TKD came out in 1992, I've been a member of the KLI and its mailing list since 1993, I'm the
author of the Klingon automated vocabulary program KLIFLASH, and I've had

          <a name="321"></a>These last two are not so much stated rules as impressions we've gotten from MO
          over the years.  You will sometimes encounter <em>ad-hoc</em> compounds.  But beware of
          the "hind-sight" effect: the compound word that seems so clear to you may make
          no sense at all to someone else.

3.3.2 Number<p>
</p><blockquote>
          <a name="332"></a>There is evidently some latitude in the grey areas.  MO tells us on the MSN forum
          that <strong><font color="#DD3615">DIr</font></strong> has the plurals <strong><font color="#DD3615">DIrDu'</font></strong> and <strong><font color="#DD3615">DIrmey</font></strong> depending on
          whether it is still on the animal, or off of it. (Does this mean that, if
          I serve my guests Pipius Claw and each one gets several, I would
          refer to them as <strong><font color="#DD3615">pachmey</font></strong>?).  However, in KGT, he describes the
          handles of a type of pot as <strong><font color="#DD3615">DeSDu'</font></strong>, although they were
          obviously never alive at all!<p>
          My theory is that Klingons are deeply interested in whether a body part is still
          attached to its body and alive <strong><font color="#DD3615">-Du'</font></strong>, or detatched and dead <strong><font color="#DD3615">-
          mey</font></strong>.  Their interest in the bodies themselves is different, where
          their only concern is whether it is a person <strong><font color="#DD3615">-pu'</font></strong> or a non-person
          <strong><font color="#DD3615">-mey</font></strong>.  In the case of inanimate objects, their interest in body
          parts causes the Klingons to confer "honorary" status as a body
          part on objects that resemble them; these objects receive the <strong><font color="#DD3615">-Du'</font></strong>
          suffix to make the identification clear.</p><p>
	 This could also be the origin of the "scattered around" meaning of
	<strong><font color="#DD3615">-mey</font></strong>.  When a body part
	is separated from its body, its plural changes from
	<strong><font color="#DD3615">-Du'</font></strong> to
	<strong><font color="#DD3615">-mey</font></strong>, and 
	separation could come to
	imply not merely removal but dispersal; eventually this "dispersal"
	meaning could be generalized to words whose usual plural is
	<strong><font color="#DD3615">-pu'</font></strong>.

3.3.5 Syntactic markers
<blockquote>
<a name="3353"></a>
As has been pointed out [HQ v6n2p2], this construction is most likely 
not an example of the N-N pattern, but a
contraction of something involving a 
<strong><font color="#DD3615">-bogh</font></strong> 
verb: <strong><font color="#DD3615">balDaq chenmoHlu'bogh
Duj</font></strong> <em>ship (which someone assembled) in a bottle</em>.  But, since they 
functionally act the same way, the point is probably moot.<p>
We usually call this the "Cat-In-The-Hat" problem; ironically,
it doesn't really apply to this situation. "In the hat" 
doesn't mean the Cat is sitting inside a hat, rather, it's an
English idiom for "wearing a hat" and would probably be translated
<strong><font color="#DD3615">mIv tuQtaHbogh vIghro'</font></strong>.
</p><p><a href="kliadd3.html#3353">Back</a></p></blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
          <a name="335"></a>This is a restricted and special usage, and should not be overused or generalized to
          other types of verbs or noun phrases. I've been trying to explain 
	  the new rules to myself:<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><strong><font color="#DD3615">X(-Daq) vI-Y</font></strong> 
</dt><dd>The ground-work for this phrase was actually laid in TKD,
where MO says that <strong>"There are a few verbs whose meanings
include locative notions, such as 
<strong><font color="#DD3615">ghoS</font></strong> <em>approach, proceed</em>.
The locative suffix need not be used on nouns which are the
objects of such verbs."</strong> [TKD, p. 28] Maybe this means the rule is now extended
to all verbs of motion, that whenever a verb of motion has an object, 
motion toward that object is assumed.  The 
<strong><font color="#DD3615">-Daq</font></strong>, we're told, is
optional, and I'm guessing is an ungrammatical usage, like leaving
<strong><font color="#DD3615">lu-</font></strong> off of plural 
<strong><font color="#DD3615">-lu'</font></strong> objects or using double negatives in English:
people are known to do it, but it's also recognized as "wrong".  I
wouldn't take it to mean that nouns with Type 5 suffixes can be
used as direct objects in general.<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong><font color="#DD3615">X-vo' vI-Y</font></strong>
</dt><dd>Except for this one, of course.  This does fly in the face
of everything we thought we knew about direct objects and Type 5
noun suffixes.  All I can guess is that this is some special
usage peculiar to <strong><font color="#DD3615">-vo'</font></strong> 
used with motion verbs.  At least, if we want 
to say <strong><font color="#DD3615">X-vo' Y vIjaH</font></strong> "I go from X to 
Y", we can
still use the same verb prefix!
But what, if
anything does <strong><font color="#DD3615">X-vo' jI-Y</font></strong> now mean? "At a distance from X, I am
Y-ing"?<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong><font color="#DD3615">X-Daq jI-Y</font></strong>  
</dt><dd>The grammar of this isn't new, the only innovation is that
it is now restricted to mean <u>only</u> some type of movement Y occuring at 
place X. 
</dd></dl><p>
So, maybe the new rules in essence are
</p><ol>
<li>To indicate motion, use a motion verb with a direct object.
  <ol>
   <li>Motion towards is the default and needs no marker.
   </li><li>Motion away from needs the marker <strong><font color="#DD3615">-vo'</font></strong>.
  </li></ol>
</li><li>To indicate location, use a motion verb (or any verb) with a
   "no object" verb prefix.
  <ol> 
  <li>Use <strong><font color="#DD3615">-Daq</font></strong> for action occuring at the point of reference.
  </li><li>Use <strong><font color="#DD3615">-vo'</font></strong> for action occuring at a remove from the point of
      reference.
  </li></ol>
</li></ol><p>
If these are correct, then the new rules have actually given us a pretty
neat new set of tools. It doesn't change our understanding of locative
phrases, but adds a way to refine the meanings we can express 
with <strong><font color="#DD3615">-Daq</font></strong> 
and <strong><font color="#DD3615">-vo'</font></strong>.
</p><p>
An unanswered question is how to use those words which, MO tells
us in TKD, never require <strong><font color="#DD3615">-Daq</font></strong>, such 
as <strong><font color="#DD3615">naDev</font></strong> or <strong><font color="#DD3615">Dat</font></strong>.  
They fit
fine in the first example: <strong><font color="#DD3615">naDev vIghoS</font></strong> "I am coming here",
but what about the other uses?  We've encountered <strong><font color="#DD3615">naDevvo'</font></strong> on the
PK tape, and it's probably still OK, but how
would you say "I walk in (i.e. while being) here": 
?<strong><font color="#DD3615">naDev jIyIt</font></strong> 
or ?<strong><font color="#DD3615">naDevDaq jIyIt</font></strong>?  
</p><p>
The observant student will note that some of the examples in TKD and
elsewhere don't agree with these new rules.  One guiding principle
of the KLI is that the newest rule is generally the most correct, so
the old examples should be considered superceded.

3.4 The noun-noun construction
<blockquote>
          <a name="34">I have long believed that the underlying logic of the
          N1-N2 construction is that the set of items specified
          by N2 is restricted to a subset specified by N1.  This
          explains not only the possessive use (<strong><font color="#DD3615">yaS taj</font></strong> "the
          officer's knife" = "of the universal set of knives, the
          one which is the officer's"), but also the Genitive
          (<strong><font color="#DD3615">peQ chem</font></strong> "magnetic field" = "of the universal set of
          fields, the one pertaining to magnetism").

          <a name="34b"></a>The difference between N-N possession and apposition is that in the former, the
          more general term comes last, preceded by the more specific, while in the latter,
          the more general term comes first. Also, in the former, the two nouns combine to
          form a new concept, while in the latter, the two nouns (or phrases) both refer to
          different aspects of the same concept (that is, "Duras's sisters" and "Betor and
          Lursa" both refer to the same persons).

          and "I give a book to you" are equivalent.  Note that
          this works only with 1st and 2nd person indirect objects,
          mainly because there'd be no way to distinguish direct
          from indirect object if both were 3rd person.

4.2.4. Cause
<BLOCKQUOTE>
          <A NAME=424></A>The effect of adding <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>-moH</FONT></STRONG> to an intransitive verb 
          is easy to understand: the verb becomes transitive and
          the original subject becomes the object: <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>poS lojmIt/
          lojmIt vIpoSmoH</FONT></STRONG> The door is open(ed)/I open the door".
          Using <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>-moH</FONT></STRONG> with verbs which are already transitive is
          more controversial.  My personal opinion is that adding
          <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>-moH</FONT></STRONG> to any verb opens up a new noun slot for the verb.
          All verbs have subjects (usually), so adding <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>-moH</FONT></STRONG> to
          an intransitive verb adds an object slot.  If a verb is
          already transitive, it already has potential objects,
          so adding <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>-moH</FONT></STRONG> doesn't change the objects, but adds
          a new noun slot, marked with <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>-vaD</FONT></STRONG>: <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DD3615>matlh Suv torgh/torghvaD
          matlh vISuvmoH</FONT></STRONG> "Torg fights Maltz/I make Torg fight Maltz".

4.2.7. Aspect
<blockquote>
       <a name="427">
          A common beginner's mistake is to assume, when telling a story, that since the
          action of the story is over, all the verbs should have 
<strong><font color="#DD3615">-ta'</font></strong> or 
<strong><font color="#DD3615">-pu'</font></strong>.  But these 
are properly used only when describing action
          completed <u>at the time of the story</u>.  You should mentally place
          yourself at the time the story is happening.  For any given verb, ask
          yourself if the action is completed at that time (a good
          rule of thumb: if you can use the word "already" to describe the
          action of the verb, it is probably perfective).  If it is completed, that
          verb takes the perfective suffix.  Since most of the verbs in your
          story are describing events occuring <u>at</u> the time of the story, they
          do not take the perfective.<p>
     One source of the confusion about this is that some of the examples in TKD itself seem to
     use <strong><font color="#DD3615">-pu'</font></strong> as a past-tense marker.  In fact, MO has admitted that originally, when he was
     designing the language, <strong><font color="#DD3615">-pu'</font></strong> was indeed intended to be a simple marker of the past
     tense.  But he changed his mind and decided to eliminate tense entirely and change <strong><font color="#DD3615">-pu'</font></strong>
     to an aspect marker.  Those examples that seem to indicate simple past slipped past the
     re-editing process.

	  (It's also possible that this usage is restricted to color adjectives,

6.2.3. Relative clauses

<a name="623"></a>
          The rule seems to be that the Head noun of the relative

          relative verb (MO: "I couldn't make the <strong><font color="#DD3615">-bogh</font></strong> thing work 
          for me with anything other than subject or object"
          [HQ v4n2p5]), but that the Head noun can take any Type 5 
          noun suffix in relation to the main verb of the sentence.  
          When the Head noun is the subject or object of the main 
          verb, too, or when it is the first element in a N-N 
          construction, it can take <strong><font color="#DD3615">-'e'</font></strong>. When it has some other 
          relationship with the main verb, it can take the appropriate 
          Type 5 Noun suffix. (This is still controversial [KLI: W. Martin, 1/27/99, Re: qID;
     KLI: A. Anderson, 1/29/99, Re: qID]<p>
          This doesn't solve the "Ship in which I fled" problem:
          in a sentence like "They attacked the ship in which I
          fled", "ship" is the object of the main verb and part of a
          locative prepositional phrase with the relative verb; the

          Although first stated in TKD, the full implications of this
	didn't become clear until later.  We especially didn't
	realize the implications of the fact that nouns could be modified with a 
	<strong><font color="#DD3615">-meH</font></strong> verb which itself had
	subjects or objects (see below).

<blockquote>
 <a name="6242"></a>
         Certain types of sentences require a verb phrase to be the subject
	of another verb.  In English, these are usually expressed by
	sentences of the type "It is X that Y"; for example, "It is good to
	see you" is equivalent to "It is good that I see you", which is
	equivalent to "(I see you) is good."  This is called
	a <em>clefted</em> expression; the Sentence-As-Subject, "(I see
	you)" is moved from subject position (with a change in form) to
	after the verb "good", and the dummy subject "It" serves as the
	marker of the clefted expression and points back to the clefted
	phrase.<p>
	Klingon has no exact equivalent of this construction, but we have
	come to see that a verb phrase with 
	<strong><font color="#DD3615">-meH</font></strong> and a noun subject
	can express the same sort of relationship:
	<strong><font color="#DD3615">QaQ qaleghmeH 'eb</font></strong>.
	There are several likely candidates for the head noun (i.e., the
	noun that serves as the actual subject and as the head of the
	<strong><font color="#DD3615">-meH</font></strong> phrase:
	<strong><font color="#DD3615">'eb, Qu', ghu'</font></strong>, etc.
	Note that this construction carries a sense of purpose that is
	absent in the English version; in most cases, this doesn't affect
	the meaning, but it may mean that certain nouns are not appropriate
	as head nouns.

<h2>Commentary: Uses of suffix <strong>-'e'</strong></h2>

The Type 5 noun suffix <strong>-'e'</strong> has been a part of the language from the beginning, but has never been fully understood. 
I have recently had some ideas that could explore more fully some of its properties. 
<p>
  There are three canon examples from TKD 
illustrating the use of <strong>-'e'</strong>.
</p><ol>
<li><strong>lujpu' jIH'e'</strong> "I and only I have failed." TKD 3.3.5 calls this use the "topic of the sentence", and
says it is used to emphasize the marked word.  <p>
 
</p></li><li><strong>puqpu' chaH qama'pu''e</strong> (TKD 6.3) – This is the classic formula for the "to be" sentence
when the "subject" of the sentence is a third-person noun, in 
which the two halves of the formula are linked to each other. <strong>-'e'</strong> is used in this formula 
mechanically, as a matter of grammatical rule.  It's tempting to consider this formula to be an equational sentence,
where the nouns on either side of the pronoun are identified with each other, but the other example from this section,
<strong>pa'DajDaq ghaHtaH la''e'</strong> "The commander is in his quarters" shows that the subject of the sentence
can have other relationships with the rest of the sentence (in this case, <strong>pa'DajDaq</strong> is adverbial).<p>

</p></li><li><strong>HaqwI''e' DaH yISam.</strong> (TKD Addendum 6.7) "Find the SURGEON now!"  Contrary to normal Klingon 
grammar, the object of the verb has been placed before the adverb, and has been "topicalized" with the 
suffix <strong>-'e'</strong>.  
<p>
</p></li><li>Moving away from TKD examples, the only other common use of <strong>-'e'</strong> is to disambiguate subject from 
object in <strong>-bogh</strong> phrases, eg. <strong>HoD'e' leghbogh yaS</strong> "The captain whom the officer saw" 
(and not *"The officer who saw the captain").  Although this usage originated in fan circles (specifically, 
HoD Qanqor), it was later endorsed by Marc Okrand and so is now also considered canon. Note that in this case,
what is being marked is the "head noun" of the relative clause, that is, the noun referenced by the rest of the
sentence; its role as subject or object of either the outer sentence or the relative clause is not changed.
</li></ol>
The suffix <strong>-'e'</strong> is unusual among Type 5 suffixes, in that it can be 
applied to nouns that can also be the subject or object of the main (or relative) verb of the sentence; all other 
Type 5 suffixes 
put the nouns to which they are affixed in the "something else" category of nouns that act in a prepositional way 
in the sentence.  But if we consider <strong>-'e'</strong> as a true Type 5 suffix, then we need to ask if there is 
some role in the 
"something else" category that a noun with <strong>-'e'</strong> could play in a sentence.  After all, in the examples above,
two (ex 1 &amp; 4) use <strong>-'e'</strong> on nouns which are also subjects or objects of a verb, but ex. 2 does not,
and, I will argue, neither does ex. 3.  Instead, I think they illustrate the use of <strong>-'e'</strong> to mark the
"something else" category of <em>focus</em>.  In other words, although Okrand consistently describes the suffix
<strong>-'e'</strong> as marking the topic of the sentence, much of the time, it is really marking focus, and that
allows us to extend its focus-marking function into other territory, as well.

<p>
Although there is some fuzziness amoung linguists in the definition of focus (Payne, pp266ff), the concensus is that
the focus of a sentence introduces new information into the utterance.
The focus of the sentence need not be the subject or the object of the main verb, but simply draws 
attention to something new in the sentence.  In the example <strong>HaqwI''e' DaH yISam</strong>, is it possible to 
think of the noun <strong>HaqwI''e'</strong> as focus, and not actually as the object of <strong>yISam</strong> at all.  
This would neatly explain why it can come before the adverb <strong>DaH</strong>.  In this interpretation, the sentence 
would be read "as for a surgeon, find (one) now!"  That this is a new focus would be derived from the context of
the sentence: presumably the notion of needing to find a surgeon had not previously come up.  Indeed, the whole
notion of "emphasis" is a kind of focus operation, introducing into the context of the sentence the new idea that
a particular noun is especially important. Moreover, Okrand gives alternative translations of the examples
from 6.3 that clearly show a role as focus, and not as subject, eg. "as for the commander, he is in his quarters."
</p><p>
If the focus of a phrase can be a true Type 5 noun, then this has some useful implications, namely in freeing us from 
having to rely on the categories of subject and object to convey everything useful we might want to say about a 
noun and its relation to a verb. The most immediate use that comes to mind is to tell what a sentence is 
"about", especially with intransitive verbs: <strong>Duj'e' qaS vay'</strong> "Something's happening with the ship."; 
<strong>Qu'lIj'e' nom yIvang</strong> "Quickly carry out your mission!"
</p><p>
It could also be a way to indicate the "subject" of phrases that would be otherwise too confusing to 
follow: <strong>vav'e' nargh  SoS SuchmeH 'eb</strong> "It is too late for Father to visit Mother." (and 
not <strong>*nargh SoS SuchmeH vav 'eb</strong>, with the confusing pair of final nouns), or to indicate the 
"subject" of constructions that don't actually have subjects: 
<strong>moQbara''e' jIH po' law' SoH po' puS</strong> "I am more skilled than you at martial arts." (as 
a substitute for the more unwieldy <strong>moQbara' wIqeltaHvIS / wIbuStaHvIS</strong>).
</p><p>
The use of the suffix <strong>-'e'</strong> in Type 5 noun relationships other than with subject or object in order 
to mark focus I believe is justified
by canon examples, and would give Klingon a little more flexibility in its expressions.</p><p>

<h2>Commentary: Use of verb suffix <strong>-moH</strong></h2>

This page proposes a theory which attempts to predict the behavior of 
the Type 5 verb suffix <strong>-moH</strong> and give a rationale for its 
behavior.  My theory hinges on the principle of a hierarchy of 
semantic roles that nouns can play in relation to verbs in the Klingon 
sentence, in the order <strong><em>actor-object-indirect object</em></strong>.  These roles 
are embodied in the parts of speech (in order) of <em>subject, object</em> 
and <em>benefactor</em> (which is expressed in Klingon by the Type 
5 noun suffix <strong>-vaD</strong>). All verbs have at least one associated
role, the subject. The addition of the suffix <strong>-moH</strong> adds a 
new actor to the verb phrase, causing the original actor to move to the 
next <u>empty</u> slot in the phrase.
<p>
We seem to have pretty good concensus on what happens when <strong>-moH</strong> is added to an intransitive verb: the original actor moves to the next unoccupied slot in the verb phrase, the  object.  Example: <strong>pIl loD</strong> 'the man is inspired' &gt; <strong>loD pIlmoH be'</strong> 'the woman inspires the man (== 'the woman causes the man to be inspired').
</p><p>
But what happens with transitive verbs, which already have filled object 
slots?  (Let me note here that transitive verbs are those which carry the 
implication of an object to complete their meaning, whether the object is 
actually present or not.)  I assert that the original actor is again displaced, but this time not to the object slot, which is already filled (at least potentially), but to the next empty slot, the indirect object, marked in Klingon by the suffix <strong>-vaD</strong>.  Example: <strong>tlhIngan Hol ghoj loD</strong> 'the man learns Klingon' &gt; <strong>loDvaD tlhIngan Hol ghojmoH be'</strong> 'the woman teaches the man Klingon'.  Since we are taking about roles filled at the lexical level of the verb, there is no change in this construction if the object is not actually present: <strong>loDvaD ghojmoH be'</strong> 'the woman teaches the man'. (What would you do with a verb that already has an indirect object?  I personally would switch to a phrase: <strong>loDvaD paq nob be'</strong> 'the woman gives the book to the man' &gt; <strong>loDvaD paq nob be' 'e' vIraD</strong> 'I make the woman give the book to the man'.)
</p><p>
Although the theory behind this behavior is my invention, I did not make up the behavior, but based it on the canon phrase <strong>ghaHvaD quHDaj qawmoH Ha'quj</strong> 'his sash reminds him of his heritage.' [Skybox card 20]  (&lt; ?<strong>quHDaj qaw ghaH</strong> 'he remembers his heritage').  The theory is an attempt to explain why it is so.
</p><p>
It turns out I didn’t invent the idea of a hierarchy of roles, either.  I discovered that the theory I had intuited is an actual  linguistic principle called a valence increasing operation.  According to this theory,  every verb has a natural set of actors (every verb has at least one, the subject!), and  many languages have ways to add more actors to a verb phrase. Adding a causative meaning (in Klingon, by adding the suffix <strong>-moH</strong>) to an intransitive verb increases the number of participants, and thus the valence, from one to two; adding it to a transitive verb increases valence from two to three.  
</p><p>
Another interesting linguistic principle may shed light on why the subjects 
of transitive and intransitive verbs behave differently with 
<strong>-moH</strong>. In an intransitive verb, the subject doesn't play 
the same role as the subject of a transitive verb.  The subject of a transitive
verb is a true actor, sometimes called an agent, who directs the action of the
verb to some target, the object. The subject of an intransitive verb is 
really the experiencer of the verb and not an agent (in 
<strong>poS lojmIt</strong>, the door is closed, experiences being 
closed, but it didn't close itself).  Thus, the subject of an intransitive 
verb has more in common with the object of a transitive verb than it does 
with its subject.  In fact, languages called <em>ergative/absolute</em> 
languages treat the subject of  intransitive verbs grammatically like an 
object of a transitive verb (eg., by giving them the same case markings), 
and reserve a different grammatical form for the subject of a 
transitive verb. Adding <strong>–moH</strong> to the intransitive verb 
introduces a true actor, the new subject, an agent who performs the action on 
the experiencer. It's easy for the experiencer to slip into the role of 
object since it's already halfway there semantically and there is no 
existing object of the original intransitive verb to block it.
</p><p>
Actually, there is no inherent reason why the third role should be the 
indirect object; the valence principle only speaks of a more peripheral 
role for the original actor (sometimes called the <em>causee</em>, as 
opposed to the new actor, the <em>causer</em>).  But our canon example above uses <strong>-vaD</strong>, so evidently the causee moves into the "benefactor" role in Klingon.  Interestingly, this is fairly common in several
Terran languages, such as Turkish and Quechua, and is called a <strong>dative-shift</strong>, although, of course,
there is no reason why this should be relevant to Klingon. 
But the valence principle does specify that the causer becomes the new subject of the verb, and that the object does not change its role.
</p><p>
I should note for completeness that there are at least two other canon 
sentences that use a transitive verb with <strong>–moH</strong> (eg. <strong>HIQoymoH</strong> 'Cause me to hear it!' [TKD 4.2.4]), which may contradict our canon example cited here, but these are inconclusive.  They don't have stated objects or 'compelled actors', and so the 'prefix trick' may be obscuring the grammatical pattern being used.  Another alternative sometimes discussed, that every verb behaves differently with <strong>-moH</strong> depending on its lexical meaning, sometimes casting the original subject as a new object, sometimes as a ‘compelled actor’ with <strong>-vaD</strong> or other Type 5 suffixes, I consider pointless to consider, mainly because concensus would never be possible, and so the rule becomes as useless as having no rule at all.
</p><p>
If language is about communication, and if users of Klingon want to treat it as a real language, then standards must be accepted and made easily applicable.  This is especially true with a community such as the Klingon language community: numerically small, geographically scattered, and with no pool of native speakers as final arbiters of correct use. Otherwise, it is likely that we will simply degenerate into isolated speakers of our own mutually unintelligible dialects.
I suggest that my theory of <strong>-moH</strong>, which predicts the behavior 
of both transitive and
intransitive verbs, agrees with canon and has a coherent principle behind it 
to explain the behavior,
could be a good standard to apply when using this suffix.
