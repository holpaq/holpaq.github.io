* CSS
** '--vgrid' should never be used for width                             :BUG:
   There are a couple of occurrences of this. Find with:
       ----------------------------------------
       grep 'width:.*vgrid' **/*.css
       ----------------------------------------
** Table borders
   These table borders are pretty. They have no overlap (good for
   semi-transparent borders).
       ----------------------------------------
       table { box-shadow: .5px .5px 0 .5px #0008; } /* lower & right */
       td, th { box-shadow: inset 1px 1px #0008; }   /* upper & left */
       ----------------------------------------
   Note that the <table> border has a spread factor in order to expand out to
   the corners.
** Rename --hgrid/--vgrid -> --indent/--blank
** Rename 'indent' -> 'indented'(?)
   Should be consistent, if we use 'hanging' rather that 'hang' then should
   also use 'indented' rather than 'indent'.
** Write some kind of guideline document for CSS
   With examples of 'hanging', 'indent' etc. -- See 'css.html' for a start of
   something.
** Table cell widths
   Currently all table cells except the last one in each row tries to obtain 1%
   width, and the last tries to fill out the entire width of the screen.
   Instead tables should not expand beyond the with needed for thee cell
   content, and if filling up the entire width (and containing line wrapping)
   the various columns should balance each other, and maintain approximately
   equal width.
* Design
* Git hooks
  Establish workflow which automatically decodes/encodes TKD, TKW and KGT on
  when needed. Need functions for:

  + diffing -- I currently use: `git diff =(./rot13 tkw.html) tkw-decoded.html`
  + adding -- Should never add to these files directly, but instead add the
    encoded content to corresponding encoded file.
  + pulling -- Should automatically update decoded versions (if possible, of
    course) on `git pull`
  + status -- Should report changes in these files.
* Programming
** TODO Move hashlink code to outside of the main() function
   Breakout the hashlink menu thingy and put into a module elsewhere in the code
** TODO Styling of tables
   Are these lines necessary?
   font-size: inherit;
   line-height: inherit;
** TODO Styling of lists
   Nested lists are not handled properly.
** TODO Linking between main document and sources
** TODO 'use strict' everywhere
** TODO Minimal CSS reset: margin/padding
** TODO Sort out CSS problem
   Each document should allow for some unique CSS (like the yellow background
   of the Klingon Grammar Addenda – kept to imitate the original) but there
   should also be a common, nice CSS that all documents use.
*** TODO Tables
    There are two different kind of tables. Tables for layouting sentence
    examples, and 'proper tables', containing tabular data.

    Reuse CSS of the prefix table in `index.html` to style tables. (Tables
    should be set in sans serif font, not use bold for Klingon, and respect the
    vertical rhythm.)
** TODO Allow for videos with transcripts
   Youtube videos with Marc is a good source for some stuff. We need to be able
   to link to it, somehow.
** TODO Allow for resizing of source & main div
** TODO Table of content function should not convert element <-> HTML
   Currently the `insertTableOfContent()` function extracts `<h#>` tags
   converts them to HTML. There's no real need for going from elements to HTML
   and then back again, and maybe we shouldn't do that?
** TODO Apply vertical rhythm more thoroughly
** TODO Use modular scale typography?
   Currently heading sizes increase kinda arbitrarily, with <h4> = 1em, <h3> =
   1.5em, <h2> = 2em and <h1> = 3em. Maybe this should be replaced by a modular
   scale? Possibly using a ratio of 2:3 (perfect fifth)?

   aspect marker [TKD p.67].

   This is often broken in canon: example Skybox s25, Skybox S26. paq’batlh
   p.162-163.

** TODO {-vo'} doesn't necessarily indicate motion
   From {may'Iq}?

   {-vo’} doesn’t necessarily indicate a *motion* away from something, as show in
   this example:

     | {pa’vo’ pagh leghlu’.} | «The room has no view.» lit. «Nothing is seen from the room.» [CK] |
** TODO Usage of pronoun with {-'e'} (from TKD example with {jIH'e'})
   The TKD example sentences {jIlujpu’ jIH} and {jIlujpu’ jIH’e’} are somewhat
   misleading, and probably reflect an earlier state of the development of the
   language.

   In Klingon, as we use it today, the using pronoun for a subject or object is
   enough to emphasize it. While relying on the prefix alone would be the
   non-emphasized version of the same sentence. Adding an {-’e’} (as
   illustrated above) on top of this is allowed, but would be somewhat over the
   top for most situations.

     | {jIlujpu’ jIH} | «I, and only I, have failed. It is I who has failed.» |
     | {jIlujpu’}     | «I have failed.»                                      |
** TODO Using {-lu'} and {-laH} together
   From KGT p.181:

   Among those suffixes that can never occur together are {-lu’} (indefinite
   subject indicator) and {-laH} («can, able»). The former is used when the
   subject is unknown or indefinite, often translated into Federation Standard
   by means of the passive voice: {jagh jonlu’} («One captures the enemy,» or
   «The enemy is captured»; {jagh,} «enemy»; {jon,} «capture»). The latter is
   used to express ability: {jagh jonlaH} («He/she can capture the enemy»). If
   it is desirable to express the ideas of «indefinite subject» and «ability»
   at the same time, such as in the sentences «One can capture the enemy» or
   «The enemy can be captured,» it is not uncommon to use the noun {vay’}
   («somebody, anybody») as the subject of the sentence: {jagh jonlaH vay’}
   («Somebody can capture the enemy,» or «Anybody can capture the enemy»).
   Nevertheless, some speakers seem to want to put the two concepts into a
   single word, and, on rare occasion, they will do so. Rather than violating
   the rules by using the two suffixes sequentially (that is, {-lu’laH} or
   {-laHlu’}), however, these speakers will say either {-luH} or {-la’},
   employing totally artificial, made-up suffixes formed by fusing {-lu’} and
   {-laH}, as in {jagh jonluH} or {jagh jonla’} («The enemy can be captured»).
   No one accepts such constructions as grammatical; their inappropriateness,
   the way they grate on the Klingon ear, is exactly what gives them
   elocutionary clout. A visitor may hear one of these odd suffixes
   occasionally, but, as with other intentionally ungrammatical forms, it is
   best to avoid using them until one is extremely comfortable with the nuances
   of Klingon style.

* DONE
** DONE Now use Minion 3 instead of Times New Roman
   CLOSED: [2020-11-24 Tue 14:50]

   Minion 3 works as a (much prettier!) drop-in replacement for Times New Roman
   (with its baseline with the vertical rhythm even lining up perfectly with
   the squares in the debug background), except for it's slightly smaller size.

   Therefore increased text size (from 18px to 20px), but continue to use Times
   New Roman as a fallback (should Minion 3 not load for some reason).

   ----------------------------------------

   + The font need to distinguish between uppercase I and lowercase L, which
     means it (probably) needs to a serif font.

   + It'd be cool to have a headline font which we can distinguish bold
     (Klingon) text. Either a font that has an extra-bold version, or a font
     that looks pretty as a headline even when it's not bold.

   + Preferably IPA should be supported (ideally we should have both a serif,
     and a sans-serif font which both support IPA).

   + Make sure the vertical rhythm works when changing the fonts!

   Minion Pro is a pretty serif font (it can be seen here
   https://theweek.com/articles/617776/how-identify-language-glance). It does
   not support IPA, but maybe a similar font can be chosen which sorta matches
   the Minion Pro look for the IPA characters? - This Stackoverflow question
   https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/47070 suggests replacing the IPA
   characters with Gentium, while scaling the font to get the same x-height as
   the surrounding Minion Pro -- but the question explains how to do this
   XeLaTeX, maybe this can be adapted for HTML?

   + List of IPA capable fonts:

   + Much better list of IPA capable fonts:
     https://www.isoglosse.de/2016/06/fonts-for-phonetic-transcriptions/

   + Even better still (though in German) list of IPA capable fonts (even
     better because it contains font examples with pictures) of the same fonts
     as the above link.

  + Fonts I've tried:
    * Brill -- It looks too squished for my taste, with tall drawn out
      characters.
